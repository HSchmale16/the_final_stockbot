                In accordance with House Rule 25 of the 115th Congress, Members, officers, and staff must file reports
                which detail travel-related expenses reimbursed by non-government sources and charitable contributions
                made in lieu of honoraria (a payment for services that do not have a set fee).

            <p>Section 304 of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 requires the Office of the Clerk to
