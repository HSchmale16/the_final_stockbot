<h1>Watch Our Congress! Help Keep Them Clean and Accountable!</h1>
<p>
    There is a constant outflow of bills from congress.
    Most of them innocent enough, but when you put the pieces together you can see posturing and blathering.
    Is this really what our politicans are supposed to do? To act like children or is it to govern and fix the
    problems in our communities?
</p>
<p>Now is the time to inform yourself and search by topics. See what was published in the past, and how trends on
    topics have changed.</p>
