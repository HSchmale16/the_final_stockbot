                <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background; Statutory Authority</HD>
                <P>The NRC's fee regulations are primarily governed by two laws: (1) the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1952 (IOAA) (31 U.S.C. 9701); and (2) the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA) (42 U.S.C. 2215). The IOAA authorizes and encourages Federal agencies to recover, to the fullest extent possible, costs attributable to services provided to identifiable recipients. Under NEIMA, the NRC must recover, to the maximum extent practicable, approximately 100 percent of its annual budget, less the budget authority for excluded activities. Under section 102(b)(1)(B) of NEIMA, “excluded activities” include any fee-relief activity as identified by the Commission, generic homeland security activities, waste incidental to reprocessing activities, Nuclear Waste Fund activities, advanced reactor regulatory infrastructure activities, Inspector General (IG) services for the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, research and development at universities in areas relevant to the NRC's mission, and a nuclear science and engineering grant program. In fiscal year (FY) 2024, in addition to the fee-relief activities identified by the Commission in prior fee rules, the resources for the Minority Serving Institutions Grant Program are also identified as a fee-relief activity to be excluded from the fee recovery requirement (see Table 1, “Excluded Activities,” of this document for the list of all excluded activities).</P>
                <P>
                    Under NEIMA, the NRC must use its IOAA authority first to collect service fees for NRC work that provides specific benefits to identifiable recipients (such as licensing work, inspections, and special projects). The NRC's regulations in part 170 of title 10 of the 
                    <E T="03">Code of Federal Regulations</E>
                     (10 CFR), “Fees for Facilities, Materials, Import and Export Licenses, and Other Regulatory Services Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as Amended,” explain how the agency collects service fees from specific beneficiaries. Because the NRC's fee recovery under the IOAA (10 CFR part 170) will not equal 100 percent of the agency's total budget authority for the FY (less the budget authority for excluded activities), the NRC also assesses “annual fees” under 10 CFR part 171, “Annual Fees for Reactor Licenses and Fuel Cycle Licenses and Materials Licenses, Including Holders of Certificates of Compliance, Registrations, and Quality Assurance Program Approvals and Government Agencies Licensed by the NRC,” to recover the remaining amount necessary to comply with NEIMA.
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Discussion</HD>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">FY 2024 Fee Collection—Overview</HD>
                <P>
                    The NRC is issuing this FY 2024 final fee rule based on the Consolidated 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51790"/>
                    Appropriations Act, 2024 (the enacted budget). The final fee rule reflects a total budget authority in the amount of $944.1 million, an increase of $16.9 million from FY 2023.
                </P>
                <P>As explained previously, certain portions of the NRC's total budget authority are excluded from NEIMA's fee recovery requirement under section 102(b)(1)(B) of NEIMA. Based on the enacted budget, these exclusions total $137.1 million, which is a decrease of $18.9 million from the FY 2024 budget request, and an increase of $0.1 million from FY 2023. These excluded activities consist of $96.8 million for fee-relief activities, $23.8 million for advanced reactor regulatory infrastructure activities, $14.0 million for generic homeland security activities, $1.0 million for waste incidental to reprocessing activities, and $1.5 million for IG services for the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. Table I summarizes the excluded activities for the FY 2024 final fee rule. The FY 2023 amounts are provided for comparison purposes.</P>

                    After accounting for the exclusions from the fee recovery requirement and net billing adjustments (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     for FY 2024 invoices that the NRC estimates will not be paid during the FY, less payments received in FY 2024 for prior-year invoices), the NRC must recover approximately $808.3 million in fees in FY 2024. Of this amount, the NRC estimates that $202.2 million will be recovered through 10 CFR part 170 service fees and approximately $606.1 million will be recovered through 10 CFR part 171 annual fees. Table II summarizes the fee recovery amounts for the FY 2024 final fee rule using the FY 2024 enacted budget and takes into account the budget authority for excluded activities and net billing adjustments. For all information presented in this final rule, individual values may not sum to totals due to rounding. Please see the work papers, available as indicated in the “Availability of Documents” section of this document, for more precise amounts.
                </P>
                <P>In FY 2024, the explanatory statement associated with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 included direction for the NRC to use $62.0 million of prior-year unobligated balances (carryover). The explanatory statement allocates $16.0 million for the University Nuclear Leadership Program (UNLP), and consistent with language in the Senate Report, the UNLP is funded in FY 2024 using carryover. The direction to use the $62.0 million in carryover also reflects the $27.1 million proposed in the FY 2024 budget request to offset the Nuclear Reactor Safety budget and an additional $18.9 million in carryover, which offsets the $18.9 million reduction in the estimated net budget authority specified in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, for the NRC's “Salaries and Expenses” account. Consistent with the requirements of NEIMA, the NRC does not assess fees in the current fiscal year for any carryover because fees are calculated based on the budget authority enacted for the current fiscal year. Fees were already assessed in the fiscal year in which the carryover was appropriated. The FY 2023 amounts are provided for comparison purposes.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">FY 2024 Fee Collection—Professional Hourly Rate</HD>
                <P>The NRC uses a professional hourly rate to assess fees under 10 CFR part 170 for specific services it provides. The professional hourly rate also helps determine flat fees (which are used for the review of certain types of license applications). This rate is applicable to all activities for which fees are assessed under §§ 170.21, “Schedule of fees for production and utilization facilities, review of standard referenced design approvals, special projects, inspections and import and export licenses,” and 170.31, “Schedule of fees for materials licenses and other regulatory services, including inspections, and import and export licenses.” The NRC's professional hourly rate is derived by adding budgeted resources for: (1) mission-direct program salaries and benefits; (2) mission-indirect program support; and (3) agency support (corporate support and the IG). The NRC then subtracts certain offsetting receipts and divides this total by the mission-direct full-time equivalent (FTE) converted to hours (the mission-direct FTE converted to hours is the product of the mission-direct FTE multiplied by the estimated annual mission-direct FTE productive hours). The only budgeted resources excluded from the professional hourly rate are those for mission-direct contract resources, which are billed to licensees separately. The following shows the professional hourly rate calculation:</P>
                <GPH SPAN="3" DEEP="35">
                    <GID>ER20JN24.003</GID>
                </GPH>
                <P>For FY 2024, the NRC is increasing the professional hourly rate from $300 to $317. The approximately 5.7 percent increase in the professional hourly rate is primarily due to an increase in the total budgeted resources of approximately $39.4 million. The increase in budgeted resources is primarily due to the following: (1) an increase in mission-direct FTE; and (2) an increase in the fully-costed FTE rate compared to FY 2023 due to an increase in salaries and benefits to support Federal pay raises for NRC employees.</P>
                <P>In addition, the NRC anticipates an increase in mission-direct FTE to support the increase in licensing and decommissioning activities. This anticipated increase in the number of mission-direct FTE compared to FY 2023 partially offsets the increase in the professional hourly rate caused by the overall increase in budgeted resources. The professional hourly rate is inversely related to the mission-direct FTE amount; therefore, as the number of mission-direct FTE increase, the professional hourly rate may decrease. Based on the FY 2024 enacted budget, the number of mission-direct FTE is expected to increase by approximately 48, primarily to support the following: (1) the review of new reactor licensing activities, including the review of standard design approvals, pre-application activities, and construction permits; (2) licensing and oversight activities for the reactor decommissioning program, which includes both power and non-power reactors in various stages of decommissioning; (3) the review of licensing actions related to enrichment and manufacturing of high assay low-enrichment uranium (HALEU) fuel and accident tolerant fuel (ATF); and (4) the review of one new fuel facility license application.</P>
                <P>The FY 2024 estimate for annual mission-direct FTE productive hours is 1,500 hours, which is a decrease from 1,551 hours in FY 2023. This estimate reflects the average number of hours that a mission-direct employee spends on mission-direct work annually. This estimate, therefore, excludes hours charged to annual leave, sick leave, holidays, training, and general administrative tasks. Table III shows the professional hourly rate calculation methodology. The FY 2023 amounts are provided for comparison purposes.</P>

                         The fees collected by the NRC for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) services and indemnity fees (financial protection required of all licensees for public liability claims at 10 CFR part 140) are subtracted from the budgeted resources amount when calculating the 10 CFR part 170 professional hourly rate, per the guidance in OMB Circular A-25, “User Charges.” The budgeted resources for FOIA activities are allocated under the product for Information Services within the Corporate Support business line. The budgeted resources for indemnity activities are allocated under the Licensing Actions and Research and Test Reactors products within the Operating Reactors business line.
                    </P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>The NRC is amending the flat application fees it charges in its schedule of fees in § 170.31 to reflect the revised professional hourly rate of $317. The NRC charges these fees to applicants for materials licenses and other regulatory services, as well as to holders of materials licenses. The NRC calculates these flat fees by multiplying the average professional staff hours needed to process the licensing actions by the professional hourly rate for FY 2024. As part of its calculations, the NRC analyzes the actual hours spent performing licensing actions and estimates the five-year average of professional staff hours that are needed to process licensing actions as part of its biennial review of fees. These actions are required by section 205(a) of the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (31 U.S.C. 902(a)(8)). The NRC performed this review for the FY 2023 proposed fee rule and will perform this review again for the FY 2025 proposed fee rule. The higher professional hourly rate of $317 is the primary reason for the increase in flat application fees (see the work papers).</P>
                <P>To simplify billing, the NRC rounds these flat fees to a minimal degree. Specifically, the NRC rounds these flat fees (up or down) in such a way that ensures both convenience for its stakeholders and minimal effects due to rounding. Accordingly, fees under $1,000 are rounded to the nearest $10, fees between $1,000 and $100,000 are rounded to the nearest $100, and fees greater than $100,000 are rounded to the nearest $1,000.</P>
                <P>The flat fees are applicable for certain materials licensing actions (see fee categories 1.C. through 1.D., 2.B. through 2.F., 3.A. through 3.S., 4.B. through 5.A., 6.A. through 9.D., 10.B., 15.A. through 15.L., 15.R., and 16 of § 170.31). Applications filed on or after the effective date of the FY 2024 final fee rule will be subject to the revised fees in the final rule. Since international activities are excluded from the fee recovery requirement, fees are not assessed for import and export licensing actions under 10 CFR parts 170 and 171.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">FY 2024 Fee Collection—Low-Level Waste Surcharge</HD>
                <P>The NRC is assessing a generic low-level waste (LLW) surcharge of $3.769 million. Disposal of LLW occurs at commercially-operated LLW disposal facilities that are licensed by either the NRC or an Agreement State. Four existing LLW disposal facilities in the United States accept various types of LLW. All are located in Agreement States and, therefore, are regulated by an Agreement State, rather than the NRC. The NRC allocates this surcharge to its licensees based on data available in the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Manifest Information Management System (MIMS). This database contains information on total LLW volumes disposed of by four generator classes: academic, industrial, medical, and utility. The ratio of waste volumes disposed of by these generator classes to total LLW volumes disposed over a period of time is used to estimate the portion of this surcharge that will be allocated to the power reactors, fuel facilities, and the materials users fee classes. The materials users fee class portion is adjusted to account for the large percentage of materials licensees that are licensed by the Agreement States rather than the NRC.</P>
                <P>The LLW surcharge amounts have changed since publication of the proposed fee rule. The DOE updated MIMS with 2024 data; because of the update, the LLW surcharge for the operating power reactors fee class decreased from 3.496 million to 3.204 million; the LLW surcharged increased from 0.418 million to 0.449 million for the fuel facilities fee class; and the LLW surcharge increased from $0.109 million to $0.117 million for the materials users fee class compared to the FY 2023 final fee rule.</P>

                <P>In accordance with SECY-05-0164, “Annual Fee Calculation Method,” the NRC rebaselines its annual fees every year. “Rebaselining” entails analyzing the budget in detail and then allocating the FY 2024 budgeted resources to various classes or subclasses of licensees. It also includes updating the number of NRC licensees in its fee calculation methodology.</P>
                <P>The NRC is revising its annual fees in §§ 171.15 and 171.16 to recover approximately 100 percent of the FY 2024 enacted budget less the budget authority for excluded activities, the estimated amount to be recovered through 10 CFR part 170 fees. The FY 2024 final fee rule reflects the utilization of $27.1 million in carryover to offset the Nuclear Reactor Safety budget.</P>
                <P>Table V shows the rebaselined fees for FY 2024 for a sample of licensee categories. The FY 2023 amounts are provided for comparison purposes.</P>

                <P>In comparison to FY 2023, the FY 2024 annual fee for the operating power reactors fee class is decreasing primarily due to the following: (1) an anticipated increase in 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings; (2) an increase in the total number of operating power reactors from 93 to 94; and (3) a reduction in the budgeted resources primarily due to the utilization of $27.1 million in carryover to offset the Nuclear Reactor Safety budget. As discussed further below, the utilization of carryover mitigates the increase in the budgeted resources for the operating power reactors fee class. The decrease in the annual fee for the operating power reactors fee class is partially offset due to the following: (1) an increase in the 10 CFR part 171 billing adjustment; and (2) an increase in the generic transportation surcharge.</P>
                <P>The 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings increased primarily due to the following: (1) an anticipated increase in hours associated with the review of an increasing number of license renewal applications; and (2) an anticipated increase in new reactor licensing activities, including the review of standard design approvals, pre-application activities, and construction permits. This increase is partially offset by an expected decline in the submission of topical reports. As explained above, because the NRC's fee recovery under 10 CFR part 170 will not equal approximately 100 percent of the agency's budget authority for the fiscal year, the NRC also assesses 10 CFR part 171 annual fees. Estimated 10 CFR part 170 billings, therefore, are inversely related to the projected annual fee for a fee class. The more the NRC estimates to collect in 10 CFR part 170 billings, the less it assesses to collect in annual fees.</P>
                <P>The decrease in the budgeted resources for the operating power reactors fee class is primarily due to the following: (1) the utilization of $27.1 million in carryover to offset the Nuclear Reactor Safety budget; (2) an expected decline in topical report submissions, guidance development, and process improvement activities; (3) a reduction in construction inspection activities due to the transition of the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (Vogtle Unit 3) and the transition of Vogtle Unit 4 from construction into operation; and (4) a reduction in rulemaking activities. The decrease in the budgeted resources is offset by an increase primarily due to the following: (1) an increase to support new reactor licensing activities, including the review of standard design approvals, pre-application activities, and construction permits; (2) an increase to support the review of license renewal applications; and (3) an increase in the fully-costed FTE rate compared to FY 2023 due to an increase in salaries and benefits.</P>
                <P>The annual fee is also affected by: (1) an increase in the 10 CFR part 171 billing adjustment due to the timing of invoices issued in FY 2023; and (2) an increase in the generic transportation surcharge due to an increase in the overall budgeted resources for certificates of compliance (CoCs) for the operating power reactors fee class.</P>
                <P>The fee-recoverable budgeted resources are divided equally among the 94 licensed operating power reactors, an increase of one operating power reactor compared to FY 2023 due the assessment of annual fees for Vogtle Unit 4, resulting in an annual fee of $5,336,000 per operating power reactor. Additionally, each licensed operating power reactor will be assessed the FY 2024 spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning annual fee of $326,000 (see Table VII and the discussion that follows). The combined FY 2024 annual fee for each operating power reactor will be $5,662,000.</P>
                <P>Section 102(b)(3)(B)(i) of NEIMA established a cap for the annual fees charged to operating reactor licensees; under this provision, the annual fee for an operating reactor licensee, to the maximum extent practicable, shall not exceed the annual fee amount per operating reactor licensee established in the FY 2015 final fee rule (80 FR 37432; June 30, 2015), adjusted for inflation. The NRC included an estimate of the operating power reactors fee class annual fee in Appendix C, “Estimated Operating Power Reactors Annual Fee,” of the FY 2024 Congressional Budget Justification (CBJ) to increase transparency for stakeholders. The NRC developed this estimate based on the allocation of the FY 2024 CBJ to fee classes under 10 CFR part 170, and allocations within the operating power reactors fee class under 10 CFR part 171. The fee estimate included in the FY 2024 CBJ assumed 94 operating power reactors in FY 2024 and applied various data assumptions from the FY 2022 final fee rule. Based on these allocations and assumptions, the operating power reactors fee class annual fee included in the FY 2024 CBJ was estimated to be $5.3 million, approximately $0.6 million below the FY 2015 operating power reactors annual fee amount adjusted for inflation of $5.9 million. The assumptions made between budget formulation and the development of this final rule have changed. The FY 2024 annual fee of $5,336,000 nonetheless remains below the FY 2015 operating power reactors fee class annual fee amount, as adjusted for inflation.</P>
                <P>In FY 2016, the NRC amended § 171.15 to establish a variable annual fee structure for light-water reactor (LWR) small modular reactors (SMRs) (81 FR 32617; May 24, 2016). In FY 2023, the NRC further amended § 171.5 to: (1) expand the applicability of the SMR variable fee structure to include non-LWR SMRs; and (2) establish an additional minimum fee and variable rate applicable to SMRs with a licensed thermal power rating of less than or equal to 250 megawatts-thermal (MWt) (88 FR 39120; June 15, 2023). This revision to the SMR variable annual fee structure retained the bundled unit concept for SMRs and the approach for calculating fees for reactors, or bundled units, with licensed thermal power ratings greater than 250 MWt.</P>
                <P>Currently, there are no operating SMRs; therefore, the NRC will not assess an annual fee in FY 2024 for this type of licensee.</P>

                <P>In comparison to FY 2023, the FY 2024 annual fee for the spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning fee class is increasing primarily due to the following: a (1) rise in the budgeted resources; (2) an increase in generic transportation costs; and (3) an expected decrease in 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings. The annual fee is partially offset by an increase in the number of licensees increasing from 123 to 124.</P>
                <P>The budgeted resources increased primarily to support the following: (1) an increase in FTEs to support licensing and oversight activities for the reactor decommissioning program, which includes both power and non-power reactors in various stages of decommissioning; and (2) an increase in the fully-costed FTE rate compared to FY 2023 due to an increase in salaries and benefits.</P>
                <P>The increase in the annual fee is also affected by these contributing factors: (1) an increase in the generic transportation surcharge due to an increase in the generic transportation budgeted resources for the spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning fee class; and (2) an increase in the 10 CFR part 171 billing adjustment due to the timing of invoices in FY 2023.</P>
                <P>The annual fee is also increasing due to a decrease in the 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings, which in turn is primarily due to the following: (1) the completion of the safety and environmental review of the Holtec HI-STORE consolidated interim storage facility application; (2) the termination of the license for the La Crosse Boiling Water Reactor; and (3) a decrease in decommissioning licensing and inspection activities at multiple sites. This decrease is expected to be partially offset by the following: (1) an increase in hours to support the review of a new fuel storage system; and (2) an increase to support the review of applications for renewals, amendments, exemptions, and inspections for independent spent fuel storage installation and dry cask storage CoCs at multiple sites.</P>
                <P>The required annual fee recovery amount is divided equally among 124 licensees, an increase of one licensee compared to FY 2023 due to the assessment of annual fees for Vogtle Unit 4, resulting in a FY 2024 annual fee of $326,000 per licensee.</P>

                <P>In comparison to FY 2023, the FY 2024 annual fee for the fuel facilities fee class is increasing primarily due to the following: (1) a rise in budgeted resources; (2) an increase in the 10 CFR part 171 billing adjustment; and (3) a decrease in 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings.</P>
                <P>
                    The budgeted resources increased primarily to support the following: (1) the review of licensing actions related to enrichment and manufacturing of HALEU fuel and ATF; (2) the continued review of the TRISO-X, LLC fuel facility license application, though as discussed below, the review has been slowed; (3) the development and maintenance of licensing guidance; (4) emergency preparedness and physical security reviews for license amendments and renewals; (5) programmatic oversight activities for Category II fuel facilities and an anticipated new fuel facility; (6) associated fuel facilities rulemaking activities; and (7) an increase in the fully-costed FTE rate compared to FY 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51796"/>
                    2023 due to an increase in salaries and benefits. The increase in budgetary resources is partially offset due to a decline in information technology (IT) services and a reduction in resources due to the delay of a new fuel facility application.
                </P>
                <P>Finally, the annual fee is also increasing due to the decrease in the 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings. The 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings are decreasing in comparison to FY 2023 primarily due to the following: (1) the slowing of the TRISO-X, LLC, fuel fabrication facility application review activities, including the development of environmental impact statement and the safety review while the NRC awaits the applicant's submittal of a major design change in December of 2024; (2) the completion of the review of Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC's license transfer application; (3) the completion of the review of the Global Nuclear Fuel Americas, LLC, amendment for an increase in enrichment activities up to 8 weight percent uranium-235; (4) the delay of the submittal of Global Nuclear Fuel Americas, LLC, amendment for an increase in enrichment activities up to 20 weight percent uranium-235; (5) a reduction in hours needed to support license amendment requests; and (6) the delay of the Niowave new medical isotope production facility application. This decrease in 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings is partially offset by increased hours to support the review of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's license renewal application for possession and use of its special nuclear material.</P>
                <P>Finally, the increase in the annual fee is also affected by these contributing factors: (1) a rise in the generic transportation surcharge due to a new CoC within the fuel facilities fee class; and (2) a surcharge in the 10 CFR part 171 billing adjustment due to the timing of invoices in FY 2023.</P>
                <P>
                    The NRC will continue allocating annual fees to individual fuel facility licensees based on the effort/fee determination matrix developed in the FY 1999 final fee rule (64 FR 31448; June 10, 1999). To briefly recap, the matrix groups licensees within this fee class into various fee categories. The matrix lists processes that are conducted at licensed sites and assigns effort factors for the safety and safeguards activities associated with each process (these effort levels are reflected in table IX). The annual fees are then distributed across the fee class based on the regulatory effort assigned by the matrix. The effort factors in the matrix represent regulatory effort that is not recovered through 10 CFR part 170 fees (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     rulemaking, guidance). Regulatory effort for activities that are subject to 10 CFR part 170 fees, such as the number of inspections, is not applicable to the effort factor.
                </P>
                <P>NRC authorized the Centrus American Centrifuge Plant to begin its HALEU demonstration program operations at the Category II level on September 21, 2023. As discussed in the FY 2024 proposed fee rule, this change in operations caused the safeguard effort factors for “scrap/waste” to increase from 0 (no effort) to 1 (low effort), “enrichment” to increase from 5 (moderate effort) to 10 (high effort) and “sensitive information” to increase from 5 (moderate effort) to 10 (high effort), resulting in an increase of the safeguards efforts factors from 11 to 22 compared to the FY 2023 final fee rule.</P>

                <P>In FY 2024, the total remaining amount of the annual fees that the NRC estimates to be recovered, $25.3 million, is attributable to safety activities, safeguards activities, and the LLW surcharge. For FY 2024, the total budgeted resources to be recovered as annual fees for safety activities are approximately $13.3 million. To calculate the annual fee, the NRC allocates this amount to each fee category based on its percentage of the total regulatory effort for safety activities. Similarly, the NRC allocates the budgeted resources that the NRC estimates to be recovered as annual fees for safeguards activities, $11.6 million, to each fee category based on its percentage of the total regulatory effort for safeguards activities. Finally, the fuel facilities fee class portion of the LLW surcharge—$0.4 million—is allocated to each fee category based on its percentage of the total regulatory effort for both safety and safeguards activities. The annual fee per licensee is then calculated by dividing the estimated total allocated budgeted resources for the fee category by the number of licensees in that fee category. The annual fee for each facility is summarized in table X.</P>

                <P>In comparison to FY 2023, the FY 2024 annual fee for the non-DOE licensee in the uranium recovery facilities fee class is increasing primarily due to a rise in budgeted resources attributed to licensing reviews associated with one licensed uranium recovery facility and two licensed, but not yet constructed, uranium recovery facilities.</P>

                    The NRC regulates DOE's Title I and Title II activities under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA).
                    <SU>2</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     The annual fee assessed to DOE includes the resources specifically budgeted for the NRC's UMTRCA Title I and Title II activities, as well as 10 percent of the remaining budgeted resources for this fee class. The NRC described the overall methodology for determining fees for UMTRCA in the FY 2002 fee rule (67 FR 42612; June 24, 2002), and the NRC continues to use this methodology. The DOE's UMTRCA annual fee is increasing compared to FY 2023 primarily due to a rise in budgeted resources needed to conduct generic work that the NRC will be performing to resolve the following: (1) issues associated with abandoned uranium mine waste cleanups and the potential waste disposal on or near uranium mill tailings sites including existing DOE sites under NRC oversight; (2) coordination on license termination strategies for sites; and (3) performance issues relating to existing cover systems at mill tailings sites. The annual fee is partially offset by a rise in the 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings for the anticipated workload increases at various DOE UMTRCA sites. The NRC assesses the remaining 90 percent of its budgeted resources to the remaining licensee in this fee class, as described in the work papers, which is reflected in table XII.

                         Congress established the two programs, Title I and Title II, under UMTRCA to protect the public and the environment from hazards associated with uranium milling. The UMTRCA Title I program is for remedial action at abandoned mill tailings sites where tailings resulted largely from production of uranium for weapons programs. The NRC also regulates DOE's UMTRCA Title II program, which is directed toward uranium mill sites licensed by the NRC or Agreement States in or after 1978.

                    Further, for any non-DOE licensees, the NRC will continue using a matrix to determine the effort levels associated with conducting generic regulatory actions for the different licensees in the uranium recovery facilities fee class; this is similar to the NRC's approach for fuel facilities, described previously. The matrix methodology for uranium recovery licensees first identifies the licensee categories included within this fee class (excluding DOE). These categories are conventional uranium mills and heap leach facilities, uranium

                     recovery (ISR) and resin ISR facilities, and mill tailings disposal facilities. The matrix identifies the types of operating activities that support and benefit these licensees, along with each activity's relative weight (see the work papers). Currently, there is only one remaining non-DOE licensee, which is a basic ISR facility. Table XIII displays the benefit factors for the non-DOE licensee in that fee category.

                <P>In comparison to FY 2023, the FY 2024 annual fee for the non-power production or utilization facilities fee class is increasing, as discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
                <P>In FY 2024, the budgeted resources decreased primarily due to a reduction in medical radioisotope production facilities workload primarily due to a delay with the SHINE Technologies LLC's (SHINE) operating license application for a medical radioisotope production facility and a delay in the construction schedule. The offset to the decline in budgetary resources is the rise in the fully-costed FTE rate compared to FY 2023 due to an increase in salaries and benefits.</P>
                <P>
                    The 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings associated with the current fleet of operating non-power production or utilization facilities licensees subject to annual fees have declined compared to FY 2023 due to a reduction in workload for license amendment activities associated with the shutdown of the General Electric Hitachi Vallecitos Nuclear Center in FY 2024. The 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings with respect to medical radioisotope production facilities and advanced research and test reactors have declined when compared with FY 2023 primarily due to the following: (1) a reduction in staff hours due to the delay with SHINE's operating license application and a delay in the construction schedule; and (2) the completion of the safety review of the Kairos Power, LLC's (Kairos) application for a permit to construct the Hermes 1 test reactor. This decline in 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings is offset due to the following: (1) the review of the Kairos Hermes 2 application for a permit to construct two test reactors; and (2) conducting pre-application meetings due to the anticipated 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51799"/>
                    submission of several license applications.
                </P>
                <P>Furthermore, the increase in the annual fee is also affected by these contributing factors: (1) an increase in the 10 CFR part 171 billing adjustment due to the timing of invoices in FY 2023; and (2) an increase in the generic transportation surcharge due to an increase in the generic transportation budgeted resources for the non-power production or utilization facilities fee class.</P>
                <P>The annual fee recovery amount is divided equally among the three non-power production or utilization facilities licensees subject to annual fees and results in an FY 2024 annual fee of $97,200 for each licensee.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">f. Rare Earth</HD>
                <P>In FY 2024, the NRC has allocated approximately $0.2 million in budgeted resources to this fee class; however, because all the budgeted resources will be recovered through service fees assessed under 10 CFR part 170, the NRC will not assess or collect annual fees in FY 2024 for this fee class.</P>

                <P>The formula for calculating 10 CFR part 171 annual fees for the various categories of materials users is described in detail in the work papers. Generally, the calculation results in a single annual fee that includes 10 CFR part 170 costs, such as amendments, renewals, inspections, and other licensing actions specific to individual fee categories.</P>
                <P>The total annual fee recovery of $46.3 million for FY 2024 shown in table XVI consists of $36.6 million for general costs, $9.5 million for inspection costs, and $0.1 million for LLW costs. To equitably and fairly allocate the $46.3 million required to be collected among approximately 2,400 diverse materials users licensees, the NRC continues to calculate the annual fees for each fee category within this class based on the 10 CFR part 170 application fees and estimated inspection costs for each fee category. Because the application fees and inspection costs are indicative of the complexity of the materials license, this approach is the methodology for allocating the generic and other regulatory costs to the diverse fee categories. This fee calculation method also considers the inspection frequency (priority), which is indicative of the safety risk and resulting regulatory costs associated with the categories of licenses.</P>
                <P>In comparison to FY 2023, the FY 2024 annual fees are increasing for all fee categories within the materials users fee class, ranging from 14 percent to 25 percent primarily due to an increase in the budgeted resources. The budgeted resources increased due to the following: (1) an increase in licensing and oversight workload, including the expected reviews of exempt distribution and sealed source device applications, updating licensing guidance, and the development of a regulatory guide on veterinary issues; (2) hiring actions to double encumber and train health physics staff to ensure an appropriate pipeline and knowledge management for future agency mission related activities; (3) support for rulemaking activities; (4) support for materials research activities; and (5) an increase in the fully-costed FTE rate compared to FY 2023 due to an increase in salaries and benefits.</P>
                <P>In addition, the FY 2024 annual fees are increasing due to the following: (1) an increase in generic transportation costs for materials users; (2) a decrease in the 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings for new licensing applications; (3) a decrease of 53 materials users licensees from FY 2023; and (4) an increase in the 10 CFR part 171 billing adjustment due to the timing of invoices issued in FY 2023.</P>
                <P>A constant multiplier is established to recover the total general costs (including allocated generic transportation costs) of $36.6 million. To derive the constant multiplier, the general cost amount is divided by the sum of all fee categories (application fee plus the inspection fee divided by inspection priority) then multiplied by the number of licensees. This calculation results in a constant multiplier of 1.29 for FY 2024. The average inspection cost is the average inspection hours for each fee category multiplied by the professional hourly rate of $317. The inspection priority is the interval between routine inspections, expressed in years. The inspection multiplier is established to recover the $9.5 million in inspection costs. To derive the inspection multiplier, the inspection costs amount is divided by the sum of all fee categories (inspection fee divided by inspection priority) then multiplied by the number of licensees. This calculation results in an inspection multiplier of 1.72 for FY 2024. The unique category costs are any special costs that the NRC has budgeted for a specific category of licenses. Please see the work papers for more detail about this classification.</P>
                <P>The annual fee being assessed to each licensee also takes into account a share of approximately $0.1 million in LLW surcharge costs allocated to the materials users fee class (see Table IV, “Allocation of LLW Surcharge, FY 2024,” of this document). The annual fee for each fee category is shown in the revision to § 171.16(d).</P>

                <P>In comparison to FY 2023, the FY 2024 annual fee for the transportation fee class is increasing primarily due to an increase in the budgeted resources; (2) a rise in the distribution of the generic transportation resources allocated to other fee classes; and (3) a decrease in the 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings.</P>
                <P>In FY 2024, the budgeted resources increased primarily to support the following: (1) rulemaking activities; (2) environmental reviews and licensing of transportation packages for ATF, the anticipated licensing review of one transportable microreactor application, other advanced reactors fuels, and microreactors; and (3) a rise in the fully-costed FTE rate compared to FY 2023 due to an increase in salaries and benefits.</P>
                <P>The increase in the annual fee is partially offset by a rise in the distribution of generic transportation resources allocated to respective other fee classes resulting from additional number of CoCs for 2024.</P>
                <P>Furthermore, the annual fee is also increasing due to a decrease in the 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings as a result of: (1) delays in submittals of major amendments of transportation packages and submittals requiring revisions to the applications; and (2) a delay in inspection activities.</P>
                <P>Consistent with the policy established in the NRC's FY 2006 final fee rule (71 FR 30722; May 30, 2006), the NRC recovers generic transportation costs unrelated to DOE by including those costs in the annual fees for licensee fee classes. The NRC continues to assess a separate annual fee under § 171.16, fee category 18.A., for DOE transportation activities. The amount of the allocated generic resources is calculated by multiplying the percentage of total CoCs used by each fee class (and DOE) by the total generic transportation resources to be recovered.</P>
                <P>This resource distribution to the licensee fee classes and DOE is shown in table XVIII. Note that for the non-power production or utilization facilities fee class, the NRC allocates the distribution to only those licensees that are subject to annual fees. Although five CoCs benefit the entire non-power production or utilization facilities fee class, only three out of 30 operating non-power production or utilization facilities licensees are subject to annual fees. Consequently, the number of CoCs used to determine the proportion of generic transportation resources allocated to annual fees for the non-power production or utilization facilities fee class has been adjusted to 0.5 so these licensees are charged a fair and equitable portion of the total fees (see the work papers).</P>

The Treasury encourages Federal agencies to use the most efficient, cost-effective, and best-suited collection and payment solutions. The Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service provides central collection and payment services to agencies to maintain the financial integrity and operational efficiency of the Federal Government.

                     Each fiscal year, the NRC follows the direction of Congress that accompanies the annual appropriations act. The FY 2024 final fee rule reflects a total budget authority in the amount of $944.1 million, which is an increase of $16.9 million from FY 2023, but a decrease of $35.1 million from the FY 2024 proposed fee rule. The estimated net budget authority (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     excluded activities) specified in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, for the NRC's “Salaries and Expenses” account reflects a decrease of $18.9 million from the FY 2024 budget request. The explanatory statement associated with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, directed the NRC to use $62.0 million of carryover. The explanatory statement allocates $16.0 million for the UNLP and language in the Senate Report demonstrates an intent for the NRC to fund the UNLP in FY 2024 using fee-based carryover. The direction to use the $62.0 million carryover also reflects the $27.1 million proposed in the FY 2024 budget request to offset the Nuclear Reactor Safety budget and an additional $18.9 million in prior-year unobligated balances, which offsets the $18.9 million reduction in the estimated net budget authority specified in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, for the NRC's “Salaries and Expenses” account. With these allocations of the $62.0 million in prior-year unobligated carryover funds, no additional carryover

                     “Most licensees must estimate and budget their NRC fees well in advance of the proposed fee rule and upon issuance must adjust their operating budget to accommodate the changes. Given the significant changes that are likely to result from the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024, we strongly encourage the NRC to use any means available to notify licensees of any substantial changes made during the crafting of the final rule. This would provide licensees the additional time needed to realign their budgets.” (NEI)

                     The NRC strives to ensure that the proposed fee rule is as accurate as possible and explains its assumptions about the budgetary resources and other factors associated with annual fees to provide the best information available regarding the fiscal year's proposed fees. The NRC discussed these assumptions during the March 7, 2024, public meeting on the FY 2024 proposed fee rule.

                    The NRC must comply with statutory requirements, including NEIMA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). NEIMA requires the NRC to recover, to the maximum extent practicable, approximately 100 percent of its total budget authority for the fiscal year less the budget authority for excluded activities, through fees assessed by the end of the fiscal year. Section 553 of the APA requires the NRC to give the public an opportunity to comment on a published proposed rule. Because the Office of Management and Budget has found the fee rule to be a major rule under the Congressional Review Act, the effective date of the final rule cannot be less than 60 days from the date of publication and must allow for timely final billing prior to the end of the fiscal year (

                     Several commenters expressed concerns about the average 22 percent annual fee increase for all operating fuel cycle facilities, which is a significant escalation in comparison to the agency's budgeted increase of 5.62% and multiples higher than the other business lines. The commenters stated that the fuel facilities business line budget and annual fees decreased for each of the fiscal years (FY 2019-FY 2022) to more accurately reflect the reduced number of operating facilities and the corresponding reduction in workload. The commenters expressed concern that increase in the annual fees in FY 2023 and FY 2024 is not efficient and limits the potential of nuclear energy advancement, and that despite the number of operating facilities remaining steady, the proposed annual fee increase is not based on quantitative workload or effort factors and does not reflect the relatively low risk profile of the existing and predicted fuel cycle facility fleet. The commenters expressed concern that the basis for the increase in the annual fee is not adequate and clear. In addition, the commenters expressed concern regarding the increase in the budget for licensing and oversight activities and the disparity between lower 10 CFR part 170 (service fees) relative to 10 CFR part 171 (annual fees). The commenters also expressed that available carryover funds should be applied to eliminate the proposed 22 percent increase above the FY 2023 levels. One commenter suggested that the NRC should apply an annual fee cap to fuel facilities, similar to the annual fee cap for operating power reactors in NEIMA. (NEI, BWXT, and Westinghouse)

                     The NRC remains mindful of the impact of its budget on the fees for the fuel facilities fee class. The NRC notes that efforts to deploy ATF and advanced reactors, along with a focus on domestic fuel supplies, have resulted in an environment with a fluctuating workload. When formulating the budget, the NRC takes into consideration various factors, including workload forecasting, historical data and trends in the business line, information from licensees and potential applicants, and uncertainty of projections. The NRC assesses the current environment and looks for significant drivers that could impact future workload. These include, but are not limited to, technical and regulatory developments that have the potential to generate additional work or reduce work (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     pre-application activities and applications for new fuel facilities, potential major amendments and license termination requests, rulemaking activities, guidance development, and oversight of the fuel facilities program), related reactor licensing work, federal funding opportunities, and geopolitical changes that could influence the availability of uranium.
                </P>
                <P>In addition, the NRC evaluates historical data and trends to measure how execution in previous years lines up with the budget assumptions at the time. The NRC uses that data to inform the budget and identify areas where the assumptions previously used have changed. Historical data allows the NRC to identify trending in quantity and/or complexity of the planned submittals, and to incorporate efficiencies gained and lessons learned from previous data.</P>
                <P>
                    The NRC also relies on communication from stakeholders to identify accurate dates for planned submittals (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     major amendment requests, renewals, and new fuel facility applications), including letters of intent provided by licensees and applicants, and collecting information from Federal partners. For large licensing projects, the NRC tries to balance the appropriate resource needs against the relative certainty that an application will be submitted on schedule.
                </P>
                <P>While the NRC understands the commenters' concerns regarding the impact of budget on the existing operating fuel facilities licensees, NEIMA requires the NRC to recover, to the maximum extent practicable, approximately 100 percent of its annual budget authority, less the budget authority for excluded activities, and to do so through a combination of both user fees and annual fees. When budgeted 10 CFR part 170 work does not materialize (due to circumstances like delayed or cancelled licensing submittals or construction inspections) changes to the annual fee for the fee class can result. This change in 10 CFR part 170 billings due to fact-of-life changes was a significant contributor to the annual fee increases in FY 2023 and FY 2024 for the fuel facilities fee class.</P>
                <P>As expressed by the commenters, from FY 2019 through FY 2022, the annual fee for fuel facilities fee class decreased each year and, after a significant decrease in the budgeted resources for the fee class from FY 2019 to FY 2020, budgeted resources remained relatively flat from FY 2020 to FY 2022. The decrease in the fuel facilities budgeted resources over this period appropriately aligned resources with the projected workload for the fuel facilities fee class at the time. For example, during this time, there were fewer license renewals, limited guidance development, and only routine licensing actions.</P>
                <P>
                    In FY 2023, the fuel facilities fee class experienced an increase in the budget by $4.2 million compared to FY 2022, which included an increase of 5.3 FTE 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51803"/>
                    and approximately $0.5 million in contract support, for licensing, oversight, and rulemaking activities. The FY 2024 fuel facilities fee class budget is $30.9 million, which includes 58.9 FTE and approximately $2.9 million in contract support resources. This is $0.9 million or 3 percent higher than the FY 2019 fuel facilities budgeted resources of $30.0 million, which included 66.7 FTE and approximately $2.0 million in contract support.
                </P>
                <P>The FY 2024 CBJ, published in March 2023, explains that the increase in budgeted resources for the fuel facilities business line supports activities such as: (1) licensing actions related to enrichment and manufacturing of HALEU fuel and ATF; (2) the review of one new fuel facility license applications; (3) programmatic oversight activities in support of Category II fuel facilities and an anticipated new fuel facility; (4) potential rulemaking for enhanced security of special nuclear material and guidance development for fuel cycle facility security; and (5) an increase in the fully-costed FTE rate compared to FY 2023 due to an increase in salaries and benefits to support Federal pay raises for NRC employees. The increase in budgetary resources is partially offset due to a decline in IT services. Additionally, changing workload drivers, including delays in the submittal of licensing activities, have impacted the FY 2024 budget for the fuel facilities business line.</P>
                <P>Consistent with NEIMA, when developing the annual fee rule, the NRC accounted for changes that occurred in the two-year interval between the development of the FY 2024 budget request, which began in FY 2022, and the enactment of the FY 2024 appropriation in March 2024.</P>
                <P>As part of developing the annual fee rule, the NRC estimates the amount of 10 CFR part 170 service fees by each fee class by analyzing billing data and the actual cost of work under NRC contracts charged to licensees and applicants for the previous four quarters. The estimate, therefore, reflects recent changes in the NRC's regulatory activities. The NRC used four quarters of the prior year invoice data to calculate fees in its FY 2024 proposed rule, and is using a combination of two quarters of the prior year and two quarters of the current year billing data (which is also updated to reflect workload changes) for this final fee rule.</P>
                <P>In the FY 2024 proposed fee rule, the 10 CFR part 170 estimated service fees for the fuel facilities fee class increased from $9.2 million in FY 2023 to $10.5 million as shown in the FY 2024 proposed fee rule, which is an increase of $1.3 million or approximately 14.1 percent compared to FY 2023.</P>
                <P>During the March 7, 2024, public meeting to discuss the FY 2024 proposed fee rule, the NRC explained that the increase in proposed annual fees for the fuel facilities fee class was primarily due to budget increases and lower than anticipated 10 CFR part 170 billings. At the public meeting, the NRC explained that the increase in proposed annual fees described in the FY 2024 proposed fee rule was primarily due to budget increases and lower than anticipated 10 CFR part 170 billings. The lower than anticipated 10 CFR part 170 billings was because of delays in the submittals of Niowave's new medical isotope production facility application and Global Nuclear Fuel-Americas amendment supporting Natrium fuel fabrication. The FY 2024 final fee rule reflects a further decrease in 10 CFR part 170 billings that was caused by the completion of more licensing actions than estimated, the further delay in commencing inspection activities for the TRISO-X, LLC new fabrication facility, the slowdown of the TRISO-X, LLC new fuel facility license application review while the NRC awaits the applicant's submittal of a major design change, and other delays in routine licensing actions.</P>
                <P>During the public meeting, the NRC identified that, during the budget formulation and execution process, it can account for fact-of-life changes and implemented these changes, where possible, in FY 2024. These changes are reflected in the FY 2024 final fee rule, where the NRC reallocated resources from the fuel facility fee class to other fee classes within the nuclear materials and waste safety control point. While these changes did not lower the final FY 2024 annual fees for the fuel facilities fee class in comparison to the annual fees in FY 2024 proposed fee rule, they did mitigate what would have been an even more significant increase.</P>
                <P>Although the NRC is aware of the impact its budgeted resources has on the fees for fuel facilities licensees subject to 10 CFR part 171 annual fees, the fee class budget is not linearly proportional to the number of licensees in the fuel facilities fee class. Resources are required to develop and maintain the infrastructure independent of the number of operational fuel facilities. The fuel facilities business line must maintain certain minimum requirements to meet the NRC's regulatory and statutory oversight role. This includes maintaining expertise in several technical areas, including integrated safety analysis, radiation protection, criticality safety, chemical safety, fire safety, emergency management, environmental protection, decommissioning, management measures, material control and accounting, physical protection, and information security. Budgeted resources in technical areas are recovered through 10 CFR part 170 user fees as well as 10 CFR part 171 annual fees. Additionally, the infrastructure costs include indirect services and the business line portion of corporate support. Indirect services include rulemaking, maintaining guidance for licensees, maintaining procedures for NRC staff, training, and travel. Corporate support includes, but is not limited to, the cost for information management and technology, security, facilities management, rent, utilities, human resources, financial management, and acquisitions.</P>
                <P>As explained above, because the NRC's fee recovery under 10 CFR part 170 will not equal approximately 100 percent of the agency's budget authority for the fiscal year (less the budget authority for excluded activities), the NRC also assesses 10 CFR part 171 annual fees. Estimated 10 CFR part 170 billings, therefore, are inversely related to the proposed annual fee for a fee class. The more the NRC estimates to collect in 10 CFR part 170 billings, the less it assesses in annual fees. While the NRC anticipated an increase in 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings in the FY 2024 proposed fee rule, this anticipated increase was not enough to offset the overall increase in budgetary resources in FY 2024. Moreover, additional decreases in 10 CFR part 170 billings occurred since the issuance of the FY 2024 proposed fee rule that contributed to the additional increase in the annual fees for the fuel facilities fee class in the FY 2024 final fee rule. The additional decreases in 10 CFR part 170 billings were caused by the completion of more licensing actions than estimated, the further delay in commencing inspection activities for the TRISO-X, LLC new fabrication facility, the slowdown of the TRISO-X, LLC new fuel facility license application review while the NRC awaits the applicant's submittal of a major design change, and other delays in routine licensing actions.</P>
                <P>
                    One commenter also recommended that the NRC apply an annual cap to fuel facilities, similar to the annual fee cap for operating power reactors in NEIMA. Section 102(b)(3)(B)(i) of NEIMA established a cap for the annual fees charged to operating reactor licensees. Under this provision, the annual fee for an operating reactor licensee, to the maximum extent practicable, shall not exceed the annual 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51804"/>
                    fee amount per operating reactor licensee established in the FY 2015 final fee rule, adjusted for inflation. NEIMA did not establish such a cap on the annual fees charged to fuel facility licensees.
                </P>
                <P>This final fee rule does not include an annual cap to fuel facilities. The NRC will continue to assess resource requirements, evaluate programmatic efficiencies, and make changes as appropriate. In addition, the NRC staff is exploring options to address the volatility in the fuel facilities fee class annual fees and will engage with the Commission as appropriate.</P>

                     The NRC recognizes that the issuance of the fee rule may not coincide with budget cycles of industry. NEIMA requires the NRC to recover, to the maximum extent practicable, approximately 100 percent of its annual budget authority, less the budget authority for excluded activities, through fees by the end of the fiscal year. The NRC must set its fees in accordance with the enacted budget. Even though the NRC does not know the amount of fees it will need to collect until after it receives an annual appropriation from Congress, the NRC starts the process of developing the fee rule in the preceding summer to allow for timely final billing prior to the end of the fiscal year, consistent with the requirements of NEIMA.
                </P>
                <P>Furthermore, the NRC must comply with additional statutory requirements, including the APA. Section 553 of the APA requires the NRC to give the public an opportunity to comment on a published proposed rule. Moreover, because OMB has found the fee rule to be a major rule under the Congressional Review Act, the effective date of this final rule cannot be less than 60 days from the date of publication and must allow for timely final billing prior to the end of the fiscal year. NEIMA requires the NRC to collect fees for FY 2024 by September 30, 2024. These scheduling constraints required the NRC to propose revisions to its fee schedules before receiving its annual appropriation.</P>
                <P>The NRC strives to ensure that the proposed fee rule is as accurate as possible and explains its assumptions about the budgetary resources and other factors associated with annual fees to provide the best information available regarding the fiscal year's proposed fees.

The NRC recognizes that the issuance of the fee rule may not coincide with budget cycles of industry; however, the NRC must promulgate a notice-and-comment rule based on the most accurate data available regarding the cost of NRC services in the context of the NRC's budget for a given fiscal year. Nonetheless, the NRC can and will continue to inform licensees of anticipated major changes in 10 CFR part 170 billings based on changes in the timing of licensing action submittals or inspection activities that could ultimately impact annual fees.</P>

                     “Approximately 83% of the fee class budget for FY2024 is from the power reactor fee class. Over the past five years the Part 170 fee-for-service collections have decreased by 24%, meaning that the NRC's fee-for-service workload has decreased by roughly 34%. Yet, over this same period, the budget for operating reactors has increased. Consequently, a greater percentage of the operating budget is required to be recovered through annual fees. . . . [T]he percentage of the operating plant budget that is derived from annual fees (currently at 76.4%) continues to increase; up from 68% in FY2019. This growing disparity between `fee-for-service' collections and `overhead,' combined with the increasing levels of carryover, point to a need for the NRC to reevaluate its budget and fee collection model.” (NEI)

                     The NRC disagrees with the commenter's suggestion that the allocation of service fees versus annual fees for the operating power reactor fee class in the FY 2024 proposed fee rule necessities a revaluation of the NRC's fee-recovery framework. The operating power reactors fee class supports the activities of the operating reactors and new reactors business lines, including both direct-billable licensing actions and those general activities that indirectly support the agency's mission in these areas. The NRC's FY 2024 CBJ provided the agency's explanation and justification for the resources requested to allow the agency to complete its mission, and the reason for the changes in the budget for the NRC compared to the prior year.
                </P>
                <P>The NRC continues to actively evaluate resource requirements to address changes that occur between budget formulation and execution, and to pursue improvements that enhance the accuracy of projections used in budget formulation. For example, the NRC considers projected operating power plant closures and other external factors when estimating workload changes in a manner that allows the agency to meet its fee collection statutory responsibilities as the industry changes. The NRC also seeks information from licensees and other entities relevant to projected workload through public meetings and other forms of public outreach, to better inform the NRC's budget formulation workload assumptions.</P>
                <P>Ultimately, however, the NRC budget is not linearly proportional to the size of the operating fleet, as there is a cost for the agency infrastructure that must be maintained independent of the number of operating power reactors in the fleet.</P>
                <P>Consistent with NEIMA, when developing the annual fee rule, the NRC considered changes that occurred in the two-year interval between the development of the FY 2024 budget request, which began in FY 2022, and the enactment of the FY 2024 appropriation in March 2024. The NRC strives to ensure that the proposed fee rule is as accurate as possible and explains its assumptions about the budgetary resources and other factors associated with annual fees to provide the best information available regarding the fiscal year's proposed fees. As part of the development of the annual fee rule, the NRC estimates the amount of 10 CFR part 170 service fees by each fee class by analyzing billing data and the actual cost of work under NRC contracts charged to licensees and applicants for the previous four quarters. The estimate, therefore, reflects any recent changes in the NRC's regulatory activities.</P>
                <P>
                    The FY 2024 proposed rule utilized four quarters of the prior year invoice data, while the NRC is using a combination of two quarters of the prior year and two quarters of the current year billing data (which is also updated to reflect workload changes) for the FY 2024 final rule. In the FY 2024 proposed fee rule, the 10 CFR part 170 estimated service fees for the operating power fee class increased from $158.9 million in FY 2023 to $165.3 million as shown in the FY 2024 proposed fee rule, which is an increase of $6.4 million or approximately 4.0 percent compared to FY 2023. As described in the FY 2024 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51805"/>
                    proposed fee rule, the 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings increased primarily due to the following: (1) an anticipated increase in hours associated with the review of an increasing number of license renewal applications; and (2) an anticipated increase in new reactor licensing activities, including the review of standard design approvals, pre-application activities, and construction permits. This estimated increase is partially offset by an expected decline in the submission of topical reports. The NRC discussed these assumptions for the operating power reactors fee class during the March 7, 2024, public meeting on the FY 2024 proposed fee rule.

                     The NRC is committed to the application of fairness and equity in the assessment of fees. Fees are reassessed annually with stakeholder engagement and published in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     for public comment. The NRC held a public meeting on March 7, 2024, to discuss the key aspects of the FY 2024 proposed fee rule, including the impact of the budget upon fees. In developing the budget, the NRC seeks information on projected workload through public meetings, letters of intent from industry, and other forms of public outreach with licensees to better inform budget formulation workload assumptions. NEIMA requires the NRC to recover, to the maximum extent practicable, approximately 100 percent of its annual budget less certain amounts excluded from this fee recovery requirement. The FY 2024 proposed fee rule was based on the FY 2024 budget request because a full-year appropriation had not yet been enacted for FY 2024. A full-year appropriation was enacted on March 9, 2024, with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, which included less total budget authority than the budget request and direction to use $62.0 million in carryover funding. As a result, the FY 2024 final fee rule reflects the NRC's re-evaluation of fees based on the FY 2024 enacted budget. In addition, the final fee rule reflects updates to estimated billings based on workload changes for each fee class.

                     “The FY2024 proposed fee rule represents a 1.5% increase in the annual fee for the three paying licensees in the fleet. Notably, we understand that in FY2025, the number of fee-paying facilities will drop from three to two. Because of this significant change (representing a 33% reduction of the fee-paying licensee base), we are concerned about the downstream effects this could place on the two remaining licensees, resulting in a disproportionate financial impact and burden. This undesirable outcome has been observed with prior year fee rules in several other business lines, including NPUFs, when the size of the fleet is significantly downsized, yet the overall business line is not commensurately reduced. The staff highlighted this fact in the February 22, 2024, Commission briefing on the research and test reactor regulatory program. The staff stated that they are currently pursuing mitigating solutions for FY2025. We look forward to hearing more from the staff on any solutions, and we are open to supporting further dialogue on this topic. As this FY2025 decrease in the number of facilities is known, we expect the NRC to reduce its resources commensurately. This is especially important considering their primary national mission of education, research, training, and outreach, as highlighted in the Atomic Energy Act, Section 104(c).” (NEI)

                     The NRC recognizes the impact of its budgeted resources on the fees for facilities involved in education, research, training, and outreach. As mentioned during the February 22, 2024, Commission meeting, and the March 7,2024, public meeting to discuss the FY 2024 proposed fee rule, the NRC is actively exploring options to address the non-power production or utilization facilities (NPUF) fee class due to the decline in number of operating NPUFs and will engage with the Commission as appropriate.
                </P>
                <P>For this fee rule, in FY 2024, the NRC budgeted activities for NPUFs to address emerging work needs and maintaining adequate oversight of the existing fleet of facilities. As discussed in the FY 2024 proposed fee rule, the NPUF budgetary resources, which are included under the operating reactors business line, decreased because of a reduction in medical radioisotope production facilities workload primarily due to a delay with the SHINE operating license application for a medical radioisotope production facility and a delay in the construction schedule. The decrease in the budgeted resources was partially offset by an increase in the fully-costed FTE rate compared to FY 2023 due to an increase in salaries and benefits. In addition, the 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings associated with the current fleet of operating NPUF licensees subject to annual fees have declined compared to FY 2023 due to a reduction in workload for license amendment activities associated with the anticipated shutdown of the General Electric Hitachi Vallecitos Nuclear Center in FY 2024. The 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings with respect to medical radioisotope production facilities and advanced research and test reactors have declined when compared with FY 2023 primarily due to the following: (1) a reduction in staff hours due to the delay with SHINE's operating license application and a delay in the construction schedule; and (2) the completion of the safety review of the Kairos application for a permit to construct the Hermes 1 test reactor. This decline in 10 CFR part 170 estimated billings is offset due to the following: (1) the review of the Kairos Hermes 2 application for a permit to construct two test reactors; and (2) conducting pre-application meetings due to the anticipated submission of several license applications.</P>
                <P>
                    While the NRC agrees that it should reduce its budget commensurate with the reduction in the number of NPUFs that pay fees, that reduction is not linearly proportional as there is a cost for the infrastructure that must be maintained independent of the number of operational NPUFs. These infrastructure costs include indirect services and the business line portion of corporate support. Indirect services include rulemaking, maintaining

                    guidance for licensees, maintaining procedures for NRC staff, training, and travel. Corporate support includes, for example, the cost for information management, IT, security, facilities management, rent, utilities, financial management, acquisitions, human resources, and policy support.

                     Several commenters expressed concern about using fee-based carryover funding for the UNLP and not complying with NEIMA. One commenter stated that “[t]he FY2024 proposed budget does not include funding for the University Nuclear Leadership Program (UNLP). However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2024 included $16 million for UNLP and directed the use of fee-based carryover funds for this purpose. This is contrary to the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA) of 2018, where UNLP is one of the activities excluded from recovery using fee-based funding. The FY2024 payment, combined with similar payments in FY2023, FY2022 and FY2021, totals $64 million in payments by licensees that should have been excluded from the fee base.”

These payments do nothing to support the agency's mission and should not be funded through fees collected from NRC licensees and, ultimately, electricity rate payers. We encourage the NRC to continue its discussions with Congress to remove these payments from the fee base.” (NEI and CEG)</P>

                     Each fiscal year, the NRC follows the direction of Congress that accompanies the annual appropriations act. In FY 2024, the explanatory statement associated with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 included direction for the NRC to use $62.0 million of carryover. The explanatory statement allocates $16.0 million for the UNLP, and consistent with language in the Senate Report, the UNLP is funded in FY 2024 using carryover.

                     “We recognize that there are no further policy changes proposed this year following last year's addition of another minimum fee and variable rate for non-light water reactors under 10 CFR 171.15. NEI encourages the NRC to consider other changes to the fee structure for micro-reactors. Specifically, the overall licensing and ongoing oversight costs for micro-reactors need to be less than 1% of the total cost of manufacture and operations. If the policy in the current fee rule places undue economic burden on micro-reactors through annual fees that do not reflect lower oversight costs, due to their simplicity and very small radionuclide inventories, then the annual fees will challenge their economic viability. The current minimum fee, set equal to that of the NPUF fee class, is expected to be a significant percentage of annual operating costs for micro-reactors. Further, the distribution of NPUF fees for dozens of reactors among a fraction of payers (only three NPUF licensees are subject to annual fees) is not representative of commercial micro-reactor expectations to each pay their share of annual fees. The scaling of many tens or hundreds of micro-reactors up to 4500 MWth will continue to propagate the disproportionate impact and there may be a need for the policy to be revisited as early as next year.” (NEI)

                     In FY 2016, the NRC amended § 171.15 to establish a variable annual fee structure for LWR SMRs (81 FR 32617; May 24, 2016). Thereafter, in FY 2023, the NRC further amended § 171.15 to: (1) expand the applicability of the SMR variable fee structure to include non-LWR SMRs; and (2) establish an additional minimum fee and variable rate applicable to SMRs with a licensed thermal power rating of less than or equal to 250 MWt (88 FR 39120; June 15, 2023).
                </P>
                <P>In developing this fee framework for SMRs, the NRC engaged with industry and other interested stakeholders to develop a knowledge base and understanding of the characteristics and proposed designs of non-LWR SMRs. The NRC also conducted public meetings with stakeholders to share information and discuss topics related to the development and licensing of non-LWRs and participated in preapplication activities with several applicants. During these public meetings, the NRC staff discussed possible approaches to assessing annual fees for non-LWR SMRs. Stakeholders recommended that the NRC consider lower fees for non-LWR SMRs and requested the NRC proceed with rulemaking expeditiously. In developing an approach to assess annual fees to future non-LWR SMRs, the NRC considered stakeholder input from these public meetings and analyzed a position paper from NEI, “NEI Input on NRC Annual Fee Assessment for Non-Light Water Reactors.”</P>

                    fees to all SMRs, including micro-reactors. That said, the NRC recognizes that the annual regulatory cost associated with LWR and non-LWR SMRs is inherently uncertain before such a licensed facility is operational.

                <P>As stated in the FY 2023 final fee rule, the NRC intends to re-evaluate the variable annual fee structure at the appropriate time to ensure consistency with NEIMA. This re-evaluation will occur once SMR facilities become operational and sufficient regulatory cost data becomes available. Operational experience data should provide insights that will identify the correlation between design features and the level of NRC oversight typically needed for these new types of power plants as well as inform whether further annual fee adjustments for SMRs may be needed. As cost data and operating experience for LWR and non-LWR SMRs are accumulated, the NRC will propose adjustments to fees as needed to make sure that the fees assessed to LWR and non-LWR SMRs (and to all operating power reactors) are commensurate with the regulatory support services provided by the NRC, consistent with NEIMA.</P>

                     Several commenters expressed concerns about the annual fee increase for the spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning fee class. One commenter stated that an increase in annual and professional charges proposed for the fee class of 26.4 percent, and an increase of 117 percent since 2019, is systemically unsustainable. The commenter stated that their sites no longer produce electricity and the assumption that they will recover costs from the DOE via litigation or settlement(s) is one that ignores that the costs are not allowed for recovery. That cost is the erosion of the recovery due to the time value of money and that others do not receive full recovery of costs. Costs associated with the recovery process are not included. Another commenter stated that the FY 2024 proposed fee rule assigns the same fee for all decommissioning plants and does not distinguish between reactor sites that are actively decommissioning or moving spent fuel, which require significant active NRC oversight, and those in a SAFSTOR setting with no active fuel movement, which require much less NRC oversight. The commenters suggested that the NRC adjust the proposed rule to more accurately and equitably allocate its costs to plants in a decommissioning status based on the necessary level of NRC involvement. The commenters asked that the NRC undertake serious discussions internally, and then with the Congress and OMB, to seek long-term solutions to the dramatic and unsustainable increases in members' fees.

                     The NRC is aware of the impact of the budget on the fees for the spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning fee class that is assessed to 10 CFR part 50 and 10 CFR part 52 power reactor licensees, and on 10 CFR part 72 licensees that do not hold a 10 CFR part 50 license or a 10 CFR part 52 combined license. The spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning fee class supports the activities of the spent fuel storage and transportation and the decommissioning and LLW business lines, including both direct-billable licensing actions and those general activities that indirectly support the agency's mission in these areas.
                </P>
                <P>When formulating the budget, the NRC takes into consideration various factors, including workload forecasting, historical data and trends, information from licensees and potential applicants, and uncertainty of projections. The NRC assesses the current environment and performs workload forecasting, which includes looking for significant drivers that could impact the future workload. These include, but are not limited to, technical and regulatory developments that have the potential to generate additional work or reduce work. In addition, the NRC reviews historical data and trends to measure how execution in previous years lines up with the budget assumptions at the time. The NRC uses that data to inform the future budget and identify areas where the assumptions previously used may have changed. The NRC also relies on communications from stakeholders to identify planned submittals, including letters of intent. In budgeting for large licensing projects, the NRC tries to balance the anticipated resource needs against the relative certainty that an application will be submitted on schedule and the level of complexity.</P>
                <P>The NRC's FY 2024 CBJ, published in March 2023, provided the agency's explanation and justification for the resources being requested to allow the agency to complete its mission under the spent fuel storage and transportation and the decommissioning and LLW business lines as pertaining to the spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning fee class. As explained in the FY 2024 proposed fee rule, the spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning fee class budgeted resources increased primarily to support the following: (1) an increase in FTEs to support licensing and oversight activities for the reactor decommissioning program, which includes both power and non-power reactors in various stages of decommissioning; and (2) an increase in the fully-costed FTE rate compared to FY 2023 due to an increase in salaries and benefits to support Federal pay raises for NRC employees.</P>
                <P>While NRC recognizes the impact of its budgeted resources on the fees for the spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning facilities subject to 10 CFR part 171 annual fees, the fee class budget is not linearly proportional to the number of facilities in the fee class. Resources are required to develop and maintain the infrastructure independent of the number of facilities in the spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning fee class. The spent fuel storage and transportation and the decommissioning and LLW business lines must maintain certain minimum requirements to meet the NRC's regulatory and statutory oversight role.</P>
                <P>Consistent with NEIMA, when developing the annual fee rule, the NRC considered changes that occurred in the two-year interval between the development of the FY 2024 budget request, which began in FY 2022, and the enactment of the FY 2024 appropriation in March 2024. As part of the development of the annual fee rule, the NRC estimates the amount of 10 CFR part 170 service fees by each fee class by analyzing billing data and the actual cost of work under NRC contracts charged to licensees and applicants for the previous four quarters. The estimate, therefore, reflects any recent changes in the NRC's regulatory activities. The FY 2024 proposed rule utilized four quarters of the prior year invoice data, while the NRC is using a combination of two quarters of the prior year and two quarters of the current year billing data (which is also updated to reflect workload changes) for the FY 2024 final rule.</P>
                <P>
                    The commenters also raised concerns regarding the professional charges and that the FY 2024 proposed fee rule does not distinguish between sites that are in active decommissioning or where licensees are moving spent fuel, and those in a SAFSTOR setting that require less oversight. Under NEIMA, the NRC must use its IOAA authority first to collect 10 CFR part 170 service fees for NRC work that provides specific benefits to identifiable recipients, such as licensing activities, inspections, and special projects. In so doing, the NRC establishes a professional hourly rate for its work. To the extent that the NRC's 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51808"/>
                    work directly benefits a licensee or applicant, the NRC then collects 10 CFR part 170 user fees from that licensee or applicant. As a result, the spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning fee class facilities are only paying 10 CFR part 170 fees for work that directly benefits an entity engaged in their specific activities (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     decommissioning licensing and oversight activities, moving spent fuel, and the review of certificate of compliance applications for amendments). With respect to 10 CFR part 170 service fees, the NRC staff time spent on licensing and inspection activities is subject to change, depending on the novelty and complexity of the application under review or the facility being inspected. Because the NRC's fee recovery under the IOAA (10 CFR part 170) will not equal 100 percent of the agency's total budget authority for the fiscal year (less the budget authority for excluded activities), the NRC also assesses annual fees under 10 CFR part 171 to recover the remaining amount necessary to comply with NEIMA.
                </P>
                <P>The NRC believes that the assessment of annual fees from 10 CFR part 50 and 10 CFR part 52 power reactor licensees, and from 10 CFR part 72 licensees that do not hold a 10 CFR part 50 license or a 10 CFR part 52 combined license under spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning, is fair and equitable to recover NRC costs for generic spent fuel storage and reactor decommissioning activities. This annual fee includes the costs of the NRC's generic and other research activities directly related to reactor decommissioning and spent fuel storage, and other safety, environmental, and safeguards activities related to reactor decommissioning and spent fuel storage, except those activities which are subject 10 CFR part 170 fees. The NRC recognizes that sites will be required to continue to store spent fuel onsite until another solution becomes available. Nonetheless, NEIMA requires the NRC to recover, to the maximum extent practicable, approximately 100 percent of its annual budget less certain amounts excluded from the fee-recovery requirement.</P>
                <P>The NRC continues to actively evaluate resource requirements to address changes that occur between budget formulation and execution. The NRC will continue to evaluate programmatic efficiencies and make changes as appropriate.</P>

These matters are outside the scope of this final rule. The primary purpose of the rule is to update the NRC's fee schedules to recover approximately 100 percent of the NRC's total budget authority for the current fiscal year, less the budget authority for excluded activities, and to make other necessary corrections or appropriate changes to specific aspects of the NRC's fee regulations to ensure compliance with NEIMA.</P>
                <P>The NRC understands the importance of examining and improving the efficiency of its operations and the prioritization of its regulatory activities. Accordingly, the NRC continues to seek improvements and efficiencies in NRC operations and enhancing the agency's approach to regulating while maintaining safety and security.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Regulatory Analysis</HD>
                <P>Under NEIMA, the NRC is required to recover, to the maximum extent practicable, approximately 100 percent of its annual budget for FY 2024 less the budget authority for excluded activities. The NRC established fee methodology guidelines for 10 CFR part 170 in 1978 and established additional fee methodology guidelines for 10 CFR part 171 in 1986. In subsequent rulemakings, the NRC has adjusted its fees without changing the underlying principles of its fee policy to ensure that the NRC continues to comply with the statutory requirements for cost recovery.</P>
                <P>In this final rule, the NRC continues this longstanding approach. Therefore, the NRC did not identify any alternatives to the current fee structure guidelines and did not prepare a regulatory analysis for this final rule.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Backfitting and Issue Finality</HD>
                <P>The NRC has determined that the backfit and issue finality provisions, §§  50.109, “Backfitting”; 52.39, “Finality of early site permit determinations”; 52.63, “Finality of standard design certifications”; 52.83, “Finality of referenced NRC approvals; partial initial decision on site suitability”; 52.98, “Finality of combined licenses; information requests”; 52.145, “Finality of standard design approvals; information requests”; 52.171, “Finality of manufacturing licenses; information requests”; and 70.76, “Backfitting,” do not apply to this final rule and that a backfit analysis is not required because these amendments do not require the modification of, or addition to, (1) systems, structures, components, or the design of a facility; (2) the design approval or manufacturing license for a facility; or (3) the procedures or organization required to design, construct, or operate a facility.</P>

                <P>The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-274) requires Federal agencies to write documents in a clear, concise, and well-organized manner. The NRC wrote this document to be consistent with the Plain Writing Act, as well as the Presidential Memorandum, “Plain Language in Government Writing,” published June 10, 1998 (63 FR 31885).</P>

                <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995, Public Law 104-113, requires that Federal agencies use technical standards that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies unless the use of such a standard is inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. In this final rule, the NRC is amending the licensing, inspection, and annual fees charged to its licensees and applicants, as necessary, to recover, to the maximum extent practicable, approximately 100 percent of its annual budget for FY 2024 less the budget authority for excluded activities, as required by NEIMA. This action does not constitute the establishment of a standard that contains generally applicable requirements.</P>

                <P>The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act requires all Federal agencies to prepare a written compliance guide for each rule for which the agency is required by 5 U.S.C. 604 to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis. The NRC, in compliance with the law, prepared the “Small Entity Compliance Guide” for the FY 2023 fee rule. The compliance guide was developed when the NRC completed the small entity biennial review for FY 2023. The NRC plans to continue to use this compliance guide for FY 2024 and has relabeled the compliance guide to reflect the current FY. This compliance guide is available as indicated in the “Availability of Documents” section of this document.</P>

                                 Annual fees will be assessed based on whether a licensee held a valid license with the NRC authorizing possession and use of radioactive material during the current FY. The annual fee is waived for those materials licenses and holders of certificates, registrations, and approvals who either filed for termination of their licenses or approvals or filed for possession only/storage licenses before October 1 of the current FY, and permanently ceased licensed activities entirely before this date. Annual fees for licensees who filed for termination of a license, downgrade of a license, or for a possession-only license during the FY and for new licenses issued during the FY will be prorated in accordance with the provisions of § 171.17. If a person holds more than one license, certificate, registration, or approval, the annual fee(s) will be assessed for each license, certificate, registration, or approval held by that person. For licenses that authorize more than one activity on a single license (

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
                <P>The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's authority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority as it establishes Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at The Standing Rock Airport, Fort Yates, ND, to support IFR operations at this airport.</P>

                     (89 FR 20146; March 21, 2024) proposing to establish Class E airspace at Fort Yates, ND. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking effort by submitting 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51823"/>
                    written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received.

                    Class E airspace designations are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This document amends the current version of that order, FAA Order JO 7400.11H, dated August 11, 2023, and effective September 15, 2023. FAA Order JO 7400.11H is publicly available as listed in the 
                    <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
                     section of this document. These amendments will be published in the next update to FAA Order JO 7400.11.
                </P>
                <P>FAA Order JO 7400.11H lists Class A, B, C, D, and E airspace areas, air traffic service routes, and reporting points.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Rule</HD>
                <P>This amendment to 14 CFR part 71 establishes Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface to within a 8.2-mile radius of The Standing Rock Airport, Fort Yates, ND.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Notices and Analyses</HD>
                <P>The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that only affects air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environmental Review</HD>
                <P>The FAA has determined that this action qualifies for categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act in accordance with FAA Order 1050.1F, “Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures,” paragraph 5-6.5.a. This airspace action is not expected to cause any potentially significant environmental impacts, and no extraordinary circumstances exist that warrant preparation of an environmental assessment.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
                <P>The Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (“RPP”), comprising part 401 of title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations, govern the adoption and revision of the Commission's Comprehensive Plan and Water Resources Program, exercise of the Commission's authority pursuant to the provisions of Article 3.8 of the Delaware River Basin Compact (the “Compact”), and other actions of the Commission mandated or authorized by the Compact, including but not limited to the administration of public access to records and information in the Commission's possession.</P>
                <P>On September 28, 2023, the Commission published a proposed rule (88 FR 66722) to amend the RPP to: resolve ambiguities around the automatic termination of project approvals issued by the Commission and make conforming amendments to related provisions as appropriate; update the Commission's Water Resources Program and Project Review procedures to better conform them to current practice; remove incorrect references to the Federal Freedom of Information Act in the Commission's regulations providing for access to public records; and align pronouns with the Commission's policies regarding diversity, inclusion, and belonging. A notice of the proposed amendments appeared in the Delaware Register of Regulations, 27 Del. Reg. 196, 206, on October 1, 2023, the New Jersey Register, 55 N.J.R. 2179(a), on October 16, 2023, the New York Register, 45 N.Y. Reg. 9, on October 11, 2023, and the Pennsylvania Bulletin, 53 Pa. B. 6698, on October 28, 2023.</P>
                <P>Opportunity for public input on the proposed rules was provided during a comment period that ran from September 28, 2023, through November 30, 2023. In addition to soliciting written comments, the Commission accepted oral comment at two hearings conducted via Zoom and telephone. The Commission received a total of 209 public comment submissions, consisting of 199 written submissions and ten oral comments. The submissions typically consisted of a set of comments from a single individual or organization, and they typically addressed more than one aspect or provision of the proposed amendments. In many instances, a single submission included a set of comments by two or more individuals or organizations. Some submissions consisted of petitions or a set of comments with multiple signers. Similar or identical comments were in many instances submitted by individual commenters using form letters or template language provided by others. Commenters were not limited to a single submission, and some commenters offered two or more submissions. The “199” figure represents the number of individual written submissions the Commission received during the comment period without regard to the number of comments within a submission, the number of signers on a single submission, or the number of individuals making a joint submission.</P>
                <P>The Commission reviewed all comments and supporting material it received during the comment period. The staff, in consultation with the Commissioners, prepared a Comment and Response Document summarizing the comments on the proposed rule and setting forth the Commission's responses and revisions in detail. By Resolution No. 2024—06 on June 5, 2024, the Commission adopted the Comment and Response Document simultaneously with its adoption of the final rule.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Changes From the Proposed Rule</HD>
                <P>The final rule differs from the proposed in the following respects:</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Action on request for extension.</E>
                     The final rule provides that the Commissioners, not the Executive Director, will approve or deny all requests for extended or renewed approval under amended § 401.41(a) and (b), respectively. In conjunction with this change, rather than establishing a prescribed extension term of five years, as originally proposed, the final rule at § 401.41(a) provides for the Commissioners to grant an extension of 
                    <E T="03">up to</E>
                     five years.

                <P>
                    <E T="03">Eligibility for extension.</E>
                     Under the final rule, to qualify for extension of a docket approval that would otherwise expire under § 401.41, in addition to demonstrating that approved activities, site conditions, and the Comprehensive Plan have not materially changed, the docket holder (project sponsor) will be required to demonstrate that it is diligently pursuing the project, which can be shown through its planning, construction or project operational activities, its project expenditures, its efforts to secure government approvals necessary for the project, or its active participation in appeals of government decisions on its applications for government approvals.
                </P>
                <P>The docket holder will not be required to demonstrate that it has expended a fixed, minimum dollar amount, a proposal to which commenters objected. Nor will the docket holder be obligated to show that it has expended a substantial sum in relation to the project cost, as the rule originally provided, or that it has expended a fixed percentage representing a substantial sum in relation to the total cost of the project, as some commenters proposed. In the Commission's view, those approaches are impracticable where the project costs consist primarily of construction costs, and where the sponsor could not lawfully or reasonably commence construction because all final approvals have not been secured.</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Public process.</E>
                     In accordance with the final rule, the Commission will publish notice that it has received a request for a docket extension under § 401.41(a) and provide an opportunity for written comment of at least ten days' length on whether the docket holder has demonstrated all elements requisite for an extension—
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     that the approved activities, site conditions, and Comprehensive Plan have not materially changed, and that the project sponsor has diligently pursued the project in reliance on the Commission's approval. The project sponsor will be afforded an opportunity to respond to the comments received but will not be obligated to do so. The Commission will provide notice at least ten days prior to the date of a business meeting at which the Commissioners consider action on a request pursuant to § 401.41(a).
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Public hearing.</E>
                     The final rule provides that a public hearing on a request for a docket extension under § 401.41(a) will be held if three or more Commission members request such a hearing in writing to the Executive Director or by vote at a public meeting.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Administrative continuance.</E>
                     Under the final rule, a docket that is the subject 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51825"/>
                    of a request for extension under § 401.41(a) filed at least 90 days before the docket's expiration will be administratively continued pending final Commission action on the request in the event that such action occurs after the otherwise effective date of termination.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Construction complete.</E>
                     The final rule clarifies that if the activities authorized by the Commission's docket are limited to construction activities, an extension in accordance with § 401.41(a) is no longer required once construction is complete. Because some dockets issued for construction activities impose ongoing obligations on docket holders, the final rule further clarifies that the expiration of the docket, including any approved extension, does not eliminate ongoing docket obligations expressly identified as such in the docket approval.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Language of final § 401.41(b).</E>
                     The final language adopted for § 401.41(b) has been modified from the originally proposed language to more accurately reflect that the burden is on the docket holder to demonstrate eligibility for an extension under § 401.41(a).
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Process for re-application.</E>
                     Under the final rule, if a request for extension under § 401.41(a) is denied, and the project sponsor wishes to apply for renewal of its docket approval under paragraph (b), the project sponsor must do so by a date to be established by the Commission. In this situation, the docket approval is not thereafter administratively continued automatically. However, the Commission may, in its discretion, administratively extend the docket approval in whole or in part for a period ending on or before the date on which the Commission renders a final decision on the sponsor's renewal application.

                             Articles 11 and 13 of the Compact require certain projects to be included in the Comprehensive Plan. To add a project not yet included in the Comprehensive Plan, the project sponsor shall submit a separate application to the Commission. If following its review and public hearing the Commission approves the addition of the project to the Comprehensive Plan, the Commission's approval will include such project requirements as are necessary under the Compact and this part. All other project approvals that may be required from the Signatory Party Agency or the Commission under regulatory programs administered pursuant to this section may be issued through the One Permit Program. An application for renewal or modification of a project in the Comprehensive Plan that does not materially change the project may be submitted only to the Signatory Party Agency unless otherwise specified in the Administrative Agreement.

                    <P>Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is granting a request from the Governor of the State of Texas to voluntarily reclassify the San Antonio, Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), and Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) ozone nonattainment areas from Moderate to Serious for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The EPA is also setting the date for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ or State) to submit revised State Implementation Plans (SIPs) addressing the Serious ozone nonattainment area requirements and for the first transportation control demonstrations for these areas. The EPA is also setting the deadlines for implementation of new rules addressing Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) and for any new or revised Enhanced vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs. Finally, the TCEQ is no longer required to submit SIP revisions addressing the following requirements related to the prior classification level for these three ozone nonattainment areas: a demonstration of attainment by the prior attainment date; a Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM) analysis tied to the prior attainment date; and contingency measures specifically related to the area's failure to attain by the prior attainment date.</P>

                     In that document, we proposed to grant a request submitted by Texas Governor Greg Abbott to reclassify the San Antonio, DFW, and HGB ozone nonattainment areas from Moderate to Serious for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. We also proposed a deadline for the TCEQ to submit revisions to the SIP addressing the Serious area requirements for these areas. The SIP requirements that apply specifically to Serious areas include: Enhanced monitoring (CAA section 182(c)(1)); Emissions inventory and emissions statement rule (40 CFR 51.1300(p) and 40 CFR 51.1315); Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) (40 CFR 51.1310); Attainment demonstration and RACM (40 CFR 51.1308 and 40 CFR 51.1312(c)); RACT (40 CFR 51.1312); Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) (40 CFR 51.1314 and 40 CFR 51.165); Enhanced I/M (CAA section 182(c)(3) and 40 CFR 51 Subpart S); Clean-fuel vehicle programs (CAA section 182(c)(4));

                    <FTREF/>
                     and Contingency measures (CAA sections 172(c)(9) and 182(c)(9)). In addition, a demonstration evaluating the need for a transportation control measure program (CAA section 182(c)(5)) is also required. We also proposed and took comment on a range of deadlines for the TCEQ to submit revisions to the SIP addressing the Serious area requirements, from 12 to 18 months from the effective date of the EPA's final rule reclassifying the San Antonio, DFW, and HGB areas as Serious. We also proposed a deadline for implementation of new RACT rules as expeditiously as practicable but no later than January 1, 2026, and proposed a deadline for any new or revised Enhanced vehicle I/M programs (for areas that do not need I/M emission reductions for attainment or RFP SIP purposes) to be fully implemented as expeditiously as practicable but no later than four years after the effective date of EPA's final rule reclassifying these areas as Serious. We also proposed a deadline for the first transportation control demonstration to be submitted two years after the attainment demonstration due date.

                         In June 2022, the EPA released new guidance that provides several options for states to either continue to rely upon their existing Clean Fuel Fleets Program, to add new components to these programs, or to rely on recent EPA regulations to satisfy the Clean Fuel Fleets requirement. This new guidance reaffirms and supplements the 1998 guidance with new compliance options. This guidance is posted at

                <P>
                    The January 2024 proposal also outlined EPA's interpretation that following voluntary reclassification, a state is no longer required to submit certain SIP revisions addressing the following requirements related to the prior classification level for an ozone nonattainment area because they are tied to the prior (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     Moderate) attainment date: (1) a demonstration of attainment by the prior attainment date, (2) a RACM analysis tied to the prior attainment date, and (3) contingency measures specifically related to the area's failure to attain by the prior attainment date. Accordingly, with this final voluntary reclassification of the San Antonio, DFW, and HGB areas as Serious for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, Texas is no longer required to submit these three identified SIP elements as they relate to the Moderate classification level, and EPA's October 18, 2023, Finding of Failure to Submit is moot as to these specific SIP elements for Texas.

                    <FTREF/>
                     However, as described in our January 2024 proposal, there remain several Moderate area SIP requirements that continue to be required after these areas are voluntarily reclassified as Serious because they are not dependent upon the Moderate attainment date itself.

                    <E T="03">Response:</E>
                     The EPA is granting the request to reclassify the San Antonio, DFW, and HGB nonattainment areas from Moderate to Serious for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, but we disagree that a direct final action is appropriate in this circumstance for several reasons. First, our January 2024 proposal proposed to determine that the EPA's October 2023 findings with respect to the Texas SIP revisions for the demonstration of attainment by the prior attainment date, the RACM analysis tied to the prior attainment date, and contingency measures specifically related to the area's failure to attain by the prior attainment date for the Moderate classification are now moot, and that the associated deadlines triggered by the October 2023 findings for imposition of sanctions or promulgation of a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) no longer apply with respect to these three elements. Second, our January 2024 proposal requested comments on deadlines proposed for SIP submission and for implementation of certain CAA requirements, which we are required to establish pursuant to CAA section 182(i). Thus, the proposal provides the public an opportunity to review and comment upon the proposed actions and deadlines. Finally, we disagree that a direct final action is a required vehicle to grant the voluntary reclassification request. CAA section 181(b)(3) provides that the EPA “shall publish a notice in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     of any such request and of action by the Administrator granting the request” but does not dictate the form of such 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     action. Our action here is consistent with section 181(b)(3) and with a prior action granting the Texas Governor's request to reclassify the HGB area from Moderate to Severe for the 1997 ozone NAAQS, where we did not issue a direct final action but instead, used the same notice-and-comment format as we have here.

                     The Office of the Harris County Attorney asks that EPA provide guidance on how it interprets CAA section 181(b)(3) in the event a governor requests a reclassification after a missed SIP deadline. The commenter contends that the Governor's reclassification request and the reasoning behind it is contrary to the intent of the CAA, which is not to protect industry and economy but the people living and breathing in Texas. The commenter states that the January 2024 proposal, if finalized, would give Texas several years to complete certain SIP requirements, and EPA has found some requirements pertaining to the prior attainment date to now be moot. The commenter states that this sets a precedent which may further delay ozone improvements, in contravention to the intent of the CAA. The commenter suggests clarifications on which requirements would be moot, deadlines, and other issues addressed in the January 2024 proposal would be helpful for both stakeholders and states when contemplating the consequences of such an action.

                     CAA section 181(b)(3) does not require states to provide a reason for their request for a voluntary reclassification, nor does it condition EPA's action on the request on such reasoning. Consistent with 40 CFR 51.1303(b), “[a] state may request, and the Administrator must approve, a higher classification for an area 
                    <E T="03">for any reason</E>

                     Reclassification is a legitimate method provided by the CAA to address the circumstances of the San Antonio, DFW, and HGB areas—as illustrated by the TCEQ's proposed Moderate attainment demonstration SIP revisions for these areas that indicated, based on the TCEQ's modeling and available data, these three areas were not expected to attain the 2015 ozone NAAQS by their 2024 attainment dates.

                    We disagree that approving the request to reclassify the area from Moderate to Serious would delay implementation of the CAA SIP requirements in a manner inconsistent with the CAA. The commenter did not describe which ozone improvements would be delayed. Our January 2024 proposal did not propose delays for the Moderate or Serious area SIP submissions. As mentioned in our January 2024 proposal, upon reclassification, stationary air pollution sources in the San Antonio, DFW, and HGB ozone nonattainment areas will be subject to Serious ozone nonattainment area NSR and Title V permit requirements. The source applicability thresholds for major sources and major source modification emissions will be 50 tons per year (tpy) for volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO

We note that the DFW and HGB areas are classified as Severe under the 2008 ozone NAAQS and thus, the more stringent Severe area requirements are currently being implemented—and will continue to be implemented—in those areas.

                     Our January 2024 proposal listed the remaining Moderate area SIP requirements that continue to be required after these areas are reclassified as Serious, which are: (1) a 15 percent rate-of-progress (ROP) plan (40 CFR 51.1310), (2) contingency measures for failure to achieve RFP, including the 15 percent ROP requirement for Moderate areas (CAA sections 172(c)(9) and 182(c)(9)), (3) a RACT demonstration (40 CFR 51.1312), (4) Nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR) rules (40 CFR 51.165), and (5) a Basic I/M program (CAA section 182(b)(4) and 40 CFR 51 subpart S). Because these SIP requirements are not dependent upon the Moderate attainment date itself, voluntary reclassification does not

Reclassifying the areas as Serious in response to a reclassification request does not result in an attainment date that is any later than the attainment date that would have applied had the area been initially classified as Serious, and the Serious requirements that depend on that date are all still applicable.

                    We disagree that approving the request to reclassify the area from Moderate to Serious would set a precedent that may further delay ozone improvements, as suggested by the commenter. We note that our approval of the prior Texas Governor's request to reclassify the HGB area from Moderate to Severe for the 1997 ozone NAAQS provided that once reclassified, the area would no longer be required to submit an attainment demonstration for the prior classification.

                     In our January 2024 proposal, we explained that once reclassified as Serious, these three areas have a new statutory attainment deadline, so certain SIP elements (in this case, specifically, the Moderate area attainment demonstration and the associated RACM and contingency measures for failure to attain) that are dependent on the Moderate attainment deadline are no longer applicable or required for the lower, superseded (in this case, Moderate) classification. None of the remaining SIP requirements for the Moderate classification and none of the SIP requirements for the Serious classification were proposed as moot or delayed in our January 2024 proposal. We also note that for the prior voluntary reclassification of the HGB area from Moderate to Severe for the 1997 ozone NAAQS, the HGB area was able to attain the 1997 ozone NAAQS by the end of 2014, significantly ahead of the area's June 15, 2019, attainment date.

                     The commenter states that the EPA repeatedly reassured the TCEQ that voluntary reclassification would provide an extended timeframe to meet the CAA deadlines. The commenter states that the January 2024 proposal is inconsistent with those representations as the January 2024 proposal continues to hold Texas to the Moderate nonattainment area deadlines.

                     We disagree that a voluntary reclassification provides the EPA with authority to extend existing deadlines associated with a prior nonattainment classification. The Moderate nonattainment SIP submission deadlines were established when the areas were reclassified from Marginal to Moderate and the TCEQ did not challenge the deadlines in that final action.

                     We note that the period of time between the effective date of reclassification and the area's attainment date could be greater for an area requesting a voluntary reclassification, since the effective date of reclassification would presumably occur earlier than for an area mandatorily reclassified following a Finding of Failure to Attain.

                     Commenters state that the CAA is explicit that a state has authority to request voluntary reclassification, and therefore to moot all elements required under the prior classification. Commenters state that voluntary reclassification allows the state to delay elements required under the prior classification, because the purpose of the reclassification is to permit states to develop and implement the most effective collection of measures associated with the required elements to attain the NAAQS. Commenters state that CAA section 181(b)(3) affects the CAA's other provisions that are key to reclassification. Commenters state that when a state exercises its authority under CAA section 181(b)(3), the voluntary reclassification works on the CAA's other components and abrogates the need for submittals associated with the lower classification.

                     The EPA disagrees. Commenters assert that voluntary reclassification to a higher classification exempts a state from needing to make a submittal for any SIP elements addressing the lower classification, but this assertion is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute. Specifically, CAA section 182(c) states that “each State in which all or part of a Serious Area is located shall, with respect to the Serious Area . . . make the submissions described under subsection (b) of this section (relating to Moderate Areas) and shall also submit the revisions to the applicable implementation plan (including the plan items) described under this subsection.” Thus, the CAA clearly requires that Serious areas meet Moderate area requirements in addition to Serious area requirements (
                    <E T="03">see</E>
                     CAA section 182(c)). These Moderate area requirements apply to areas initially classified as Serious as well as areas reclassified as Serious, whether their reclassification as Serious is mandatory as a result of failure to attain or is voluntary in response to a reclassification request. The CAA does not otherwise provide for delaying Moderate area requirement deadlines beyond their prescribed timeframes, regardless of how the area came to become classified as Serious. What the voluntary reclassification does provide is additional lead time before the attainment date, as compared to a mandatory reclassification, for the state to adopt and implement such measures as necessary to attain while recognizing that the CAA requires that reasonable further progress as required for Moderate areas must still be achieved.

                <P>
                    Our approach here is consistent with past actions to grant voluntary reclassifications. When Texas previously requested a voluntary reclassification for the HGB area from Moderate to Severe under the 1997 ozone NAAQS, we stated that, “Texas has a continuing responsibility for certain elements of the Moderate area requirements. EPA has stated that reclassification does not provide a basis for extending submission deadlines for SIP elements unrelated to the attainment demonstration that were due for the area's Moderate classification.”

                     Commenters disagree with EPA's assertion that RFP requirements are not tied to the attainment date and therefore cannot be mooted for the Moderate classification upon reclassification as Serious. Commenters state that EPA's assertion that RFP requirements are not tied to the attainment date runs counter to plain language in CAA section 182(b)(1)(A), which states: “Such plan shall provide for such specific annual reductions in emissions of volatile organic compounds [VOC] and oxides of nitrogen [NO
                    <E T="52">X</E>
                    ] as necessary to attain the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone 
                    <E T="03">by the attainment date applicable under this chapter”</E>
                     [emphasis added by commenters]; as well as CAA section 182(c)(2)(B), which states: “A demonstration that the plan, as revised, will result in VOC emissions reductions from the baseline emissions . . . 
                    <E T="03">until the attainment date</E>
                    ” [emphasis added by commenters]. Commenters state that while an RFP SIP revision is not designed to demonstrate attainment, the timing of the emissions reduction targets for the Moderate RFP demonstration are based on the attainment deadline for that Moderate classification, and the Moderate RFP contingency measures would be required if an area fails to meet those RFP targets that are based on the Moderate attainment deadline. Commenters state that EPA's argument for superseding the attainment demonstration and RACM requirements is that “EPA interprets the CAA such that following reclassification, any required attainment demonstration and associated RACM analysis must be done with respect to the new and current applicable attainment date.” Commenters state that this interpretation should also apply to RFP as a new demonstration would be required with targets based on the Serious classification attainment date. Commenters add that the targets based on the Moderate attainment date would also be demonstrated within the Serious classification RFP SIP revision using the most recent emissions development methods (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>

                     Commenters' assertions that RFP is tied to the attainment date as they suggest is inconsistent with the RFP requirements established in the implementing regulations for the 2015 ozone NAAQS which are based on a long-held EPA interpretation of RFP for ozone nonattainment areas. As commenters note, Moderate and higher ozone nonattainment areas are subject to the general requirements for nonattainment plans in CAA subpart 1 and the specific requirements for ozone areas in CAA subpart 2, including the requirements related to RFP and attainment. This is consistent with the structure of the CAA as modified under the 1990 amendments, which introduced additional subparts to part D of title I of the CAA to address requirements for specific NAAQS pollutants, including ozone (subpart 2), carbon monoxide (subpart 3), particulate matter (subpart 4), and sulfur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, and lead (subpart 5).
                </P>
                <P>
                    These subparts apply tailored requirements for these pollutants, including those based on an area's designation and classification, in addition to and often in place of the generally applicable provisions retained in subpart 1. While CAA section 172(c)(2) of subpart 1 states only that nonattainment plans “shall require reasonable further progress,” CAA sections 182(b)(1) and 182(c)(2)(B) of subpart 2 provide specific percent reduction targets for ozone nonattainment areas to meet the RFP requirement. Put another way, subpart 2 defines RFP for ozone nonattainment areas by specifying the incremental amount of emissions reduction required by set dates for those areas.

                     For Moderate ozone nonattainment areas, CAA section 182(b)(1) defines RFP by setting a specific 15 percent VOC reduction requirement over the first six years of the plan. The 15 percent reduction is “the base program that all moderate and above areas must meet. This base program is necessary to ensure actual progress toward attainment in the face of uncertainties inherent with SIP planning.”

With respect to the 1-hour ozone NAAQS, the EPA stated that, by meeting the specific percent reduction requirements in CAA sections 182(b)(1) and 182(c)(2)(B), the state will also satisfy the general RFP requirements of section 172(c)(2) for the time period discussed.

                    The EPA has adapted the RFP requirements under the CAA to implement the three 8-hour ozone NAAQS that have been promulgated since the 1990 CAA Amendments. In the “Phase 2” SIP Requirements Rule for the 1997 Ozone NAAQS (Phase 2 rule),

                    In 2015, the EPA replaced the regulations promulgated through the Phase 2 rule with the regulations promulgated through the 2008 Ozone SIP Requirements Rule (SRR).
                    <SU>19</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     In the 2008 Ozone SRR, the EPA established RFP requirements for the 2008 ozone NAAQS that are similar, in most respects, to those in the Phase 2 rule for the 1997 ozone NAAQS but that do not define RFP for certain Moderate areas in terms of the reductions needed for attainment.
                    <SU>20</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     More explicitly, in the 2008 Ozone SRR, the EPA defined RFP as meaning both the “emissions reductions required under CAA section 172(c)(2) 
                    <E T="03">which the EPA interprets to be an average 3 percent per year emissions reductions of either VOC or NO</E>
                    <E T="54">X</E>
                     and CAA sections 182(c)(2)(B) and (c)(2)(C) and the 15 percent reductions over the first six years of the plan and the following three percent per year average under 40 CFR 51.1110.”

                     Thus, under the 2008 Ozone SRR, the RFP emissions reductions required for Serious or higher ozone nonattainment areas under CAA section 172(c)(2) are based on a set annual percentage found in the CAA, not on the specific attainment needs for the area. In this regard, EPA has been even more explicit in our SRR for the

                <P>In the SRR for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS, which is the set of regulations that governs the EPA's action here, RFP is defined in terms of percent reduction from the area's emissions in the baseline year, not in terms of the reductions necessary for attainment. In other words, for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, the requirement to demonstrate RFP is independent of the requirement to demonstrate attainment by the attainment date. RFP for the 2015 ozone NAAQS represents the minimum progress that is required under the CAA, and our regulations, and does not necessarily need to provide for the reductions necessary to achieve attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the attainment date, which could vary largely from one nonattainment area to another. For all of these reasons, EPA disagrees with commenter's claim that RFP should be treated the same as the Moderate area attainment demonstration, RACM, and contingency measures for failure to attain. EPA's explanation for why those three particular SIP elements are no longer required following a voluntary reclassification does not apply to the Moderate area RFP SIP element. Unlike the other three SIP elements, RFP is not “tied to the applicable attainment deadline” as explained above.</P>
                <P>Moreover, the SRR for the 2015 ozone NAAQS lists RFP and ROP as distinct provisions for implementation. See 40 CFR 51.1300(l), 51.1300(m), 51.1310(a)(2)(i) and 51.1310(a)(4)(i). These provisions clearly demonstrate the necessity for RFP reductions during the first 6 years of the plan, regardless of the area's initial classification, or whether it was Moderate before reclassifying as Serious, whether voluntarily, or mandatorily. EPA therefore disagrees with the commenter's implicit suggestion that the Moderate area RFP SIP submittal should be delayed until submitted within the Serious area RFP SIP submittal, as that would further delay submission of the Moderate RFP plans, which are addressed in our October 2023 findings. The Moderate RFP SIP submittal was due to EPA on January 1, 2023, and the State will also be required to provide an RFP SIP submittal for the Serious classification by January 1, 2026. Considering the reasoning above explaining that the State is still required to provide an RFP demonstration for the Moderate classification, and the undisputed fact that the area is required to demonstrate RFP for this time period, the EPA is not convinced by the commenter that further delay of the RFP demonstration is warranted.</P>

                    <E T="03">Comment:</E>
                     Commenters state that the EPA's proposal to require Texas to continue to meet Moderate RFP and contingency measure obligations does not align with EPA's rationale in its Clean Data Policy (40 CFR 51.1318), which provides that elements related to the attainment date, including RFP and contingency measure obligations, are eligible for suspension if the area is meeting the NAAQS. Commenters state that the EPA has not identified a rationale for treating the nature of these elements differently in the context of voluntary reclassification.

                    <E T="03">Response:</E>
                     Commenters misunderstand the purpose of the Clean Data Policy, which states, “[u]pon a determination by the EPA that an area designated nonattainment for a specific ozone NAAQS has attained that NAAQS, the requirements for such area to submit attainment demonstrations and associated RACM, RFP plans, contingency measures for failure to attain or make reasonable progress, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the ozone NAAQS for which the determination has been made, shall be suspended until such time as the area is redesignated to attainment for that NAAQS, at which time the requirements no longer apply; or the EPA determines that the area has violated that NAAQS, at which time the area is again required to submit such plans.” (40 CFR 51.1318). The rationale for treatment of RFP in the Clean Data Policy is different from the rationale used here for reclassification. While the Clean Data Policy is reasonably based on the fact that an area that is attaining the NAAQS need not make further progress toward attainment in the form of RFP reductions, it does not follow that an area that is not attaining the NAAQS would be relieved of the need to make CAA-mandated progress toward attainment as a result of it being reclassified and given a later attainment date.
                </P>
                <P>The DFW, HGB, and San Antonio areas currently are not meeting the 2015 ozone NAAQS, and thus the Clean Data Policy does not apply here. Moreover, as areas not meeting the standard, these areas must continue achieving emission reduction progress as required by the CAA and EPA's regulations.</P>

                     A commenter disagrees that RACT requirements are not tied to the attainment date and therefore cannot be mooted for the Moderate classification upon reclassification as Serious. Commenters cite to CAA section 182(b)(2)(A) that states must consider each category of VOC sources in the area covered by a control techniques guideline (CTG) document issued by the Administrator between November 15, 1990, and the date of attainment, and thus the statutory connection of the RACT review to the attainment date is clear. Commenters state that the EPA clearly bases RACT requirements on the attainment deadline for an area's classification as evidenced by this action in which EPA is proposing RACT implementation deadlines based on the timing required to influence attainment of the standard by the attainment date. Commenters state that the RACT connection to the attainment date is also evident through the connection with the classification level itself, as the RACT analysis is grounded in the review of the applicable major stationary source threshold. Commenters state that the reclassification as Serious would result in more stringent application of RACT requirements to the nonattainment areas under a major source threshold of 50 tpy, which would capture major sources under the 100 tpy Moderate classification threshold, thus eliminating the need for a submittal to address Moderate classification RACT.

                     The EPA disagrees. For reclassified areas, the RACT requirements at 40 CFR 51.1312(a)(2)(ii) and (3)(ii) obligate a state to conduct a new, individual RACT analysis for the new classification and implement any identified measures as necessary. Reclassification does not relieve the RACT obligation for the prior classification. As stated in our January 2024 proposal, the CAA requirement in section 182(b)(2) to implement RACT for specified categories of sources is implemented and assessed based on whether the RACT rules are implementing what is economically and technologically feasible and is not based on reductions needed to attain by the attainment deadline (89 FR at 5147).
                </P>
                <P>
                    We disagree that CAA section 182(b)(2)(A) provides a statutory connection of RACT to the attainment date. Section 182(b)(2)(A) states that RACT requirements apply to each category of sources covered by a CTG document issued by the Administrator between November 15, 1990, “and the date of attainment.” This language 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51834"/>
                    establishes the sources covered by the RACT analysis that a Moderate or higher area must consider. The reference to the attainment date sets an outer bound of what CTGs will define the categories of sources that fall under the Moderate RACT requirement. It does not tie the substantive RACT analysis, and the level of controls required by application of RACT, to the attainment date.
                </P>
                <P>We also disagree that the stationary source threshold set by the classification level evidences a connection between RACT and the attainment date. Just as 182(b)(2)(A) defines the categories of sources that need to be covered by a RACT assessment so too the stationary source threshold associated with a classification level defines the sources that need to be covered in the state's RACT assessment. The stationary source threshold establishes the emission levels where RACT would be applied but does not define the substance or content of the RACT analysis. In this case, the prior Moderate classification required evaluation of any sources in any category subject to a CTG and any non-CTG sources with a potential to emit more than 100 tpy of NOx or VOCs. The commenter is correct in that the new Serious classification means the State needs to address RACT for additional sources, namely non-CTG sources with a potential to emit 50 tpy or more of NOx. But the commenter has failed to explain why this fact, that RACT must be analyzed and implemented for additional smaller sources, should result in delayed submission and implementation of RACT on the original set of sources covered by the Moderate classification. If EPA were to go with such an interpretation, it would delay the requirement in this instance for Texas to submit a SIP addressing the RACT obligation from January 1, 2023, to January 1, 2026, in an area that is not attaining the 2015 ozone NAAQS. This would lead to a three-year delay in required controls in areas that have air quality that exceeds levels protective of human health and the environment. The commenter has not identified any language in the CAA that necessitates or even supports such a result.</P>
                <P>
                    Finally, the commenters point to the fact that EPA has based RACT implementation deadlines on the timing required to influence attainment of the standard by the attainment date. This is a correct characterization of EPA's action, but also does not inevitably lead to an interpretation that required SIP revisions and RACT implementation should be delayed by three years following an area's reclassification. As explained at proposal and elsewhere in this action, the substantive analysis required in a RACT SIP, namely the implementation of controls that are economically and technologically feasible, does not hinge on what level of control is needed for the area's attainment by the attainment date (this is in contrast to, 
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     the analysis required for RACM). A state's RACT SIP should be based on, and EPA will review it for, imposition of reasonably available control technology, even if that imposition of reasonably available control technology is not nearly enough to get the area to attainment by the attainment date. At the same time, it is also true that implementation of RACT-level control should aid, at least in part, in getting an area to attainment by the attainment date. It defies logic to have an area's attainment date be in 2027, but for EPA to require a SIP revision requiring RACT level controls not due until 2028. Accordingly, both of these things can be true: that RACT is not a requirement directly tied to attainment while also requiring that RACT SIPs be due and RACT-level controls be implemented in time to matter for the overall efforts to get an area to attainment.

                     Commenters state that while vehicle I/M and nonattainment new source review (NNSR) elements are not explicitly tied to the attainment date for a classification, as with the other elements, the Serious classification would supersede these requirements with more stringent requirements. Commenters repeat that the evident legislative goal of the CAA, Part D, Subpart 2 requirements for the ozone NAAQS clearly indicate that reclassification to more stringent requirements subsume the less stringent requirements. Commenters add that in cases where elements are often satisfied with the submittal of certification statements noting that the requirements have already been addressed, commonly used for addressing I/M and NNSR requirements, it is illogical to hold areas under a finding of failure to submit for elements that have already been submitted and approved under previous classifications or standards. Commenters state that submittal of a certification statement is not legally necessary for EPA to know that an element, upon which EPA has already acted and approved, has been addressed, as EPA's SIP approval actions legally stand on their own merit. Commenters state that EPA's treatment of those elements as “not submitted” is legally insufficient to support a finding of failure to submit that results in sanctions and FIP clocks. Commenters add that the infrastructure SIP submittal requirements for each NAAQS already provide certification from the state that existing regulations are adequate to meet the applicable nonattainment area planning requirements.

                     The EPA disagrees. Our January 2024 proposal did not propose to relieve the Basic I/M and Moderate NNSR requirements for the DFW, HGB, and San Antonio Moderate nonattainment areas. The Moderate nonattainment SIP submission deadlines, including the Basic I/M and Moderate NNSR requirements for the DFW, HGB, and San Antonio nonattainment areas, were established when the areas were reclassified from Marginal to Moderate and those deadlines were not challenged.

                     Our January 2024 proposal only proposed to relieve the Moderate area attainment demonstration and associated RACM demonstration and contingency measures specifically tied to the Moderate attainment date. The remaining Moderate nonattainment plan SIP deadlines, including I/M and NNSR, are not otherwise altered. We do not believe that the specific control requirements of the prior classification can or should be relieved because an area has been reclassified. More stringent NNSR and I/M are required because the area is subject to Serious requirements and in this final action, EPA is establishing submission and implementation deadlines for these new requirements but not relieving the requirements that should be implemented on the schedule set in the reclassification from Marginal to Moderate.

                    While our October 2023 findings are outside the scope of this action, the EPA disagrees that SIP certification statements triggered by a reclassification are redundant and already accomplished through other SIP processes, including approved SIP submissions under prior classifications or NAAQS. We continue to interpret the specific nonattainment planning requirements of CAA section 182 to require a state to provide a SIP submission to meet each nonattainment area planning requirement for a revised ozone NAAQS.

                     To the extent that commenters suggest the EPA should adopt a general presumption of adequacy for previously approved SIP elements, we disagree. The submission of individual nonattainment SIP elements for purposes of a reclassified area provides the public and the EPA an 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51835"/>
                    opportunity to review and comment upon each element of a nonattainment SIP. If the air agency reviews an existing SIP element and concludes it does not need to be revised in light of the reclassification, submission of a certification SIP allows the public to review the air agency's assessment and provide comment on any changes they may think necessary. The EPA then also has an opportunity to review the air agency's assessment and ensure that it is consistent with CAA requirements in relation to the reclassified area. The certification statement option is intended to streamline the SIP submission process, providing air agencies with the flexibility to address multiple SIP elements in a single certification statement, and combine the SIP certification action with other actions subject to public notice and comment. The EPA does not believe that developing and submitting certification SIP elements will be a significant and unnecessary drain on state resources. We also note with regard to the I/M programs, as discussed in 40 CFR 51 Subpart S, the vehicle fleet can change and impact whether the program continues to meet the required performance standard.

                     The EPA disagrees. As noted in our January 2024 proposal, the attainment demonstration with respect to the Moderate attainment date, the RACM analysis with respect to the Moderate attainment date, and contingency measures for failure to attain by the Moderate attainment date are all dependent on the Moderate attainment date. Once voluntarily reclassified, the area no longer has a Moderate attainment date. However, the other Moderate area requirements remain in place, even as the state works to implement the requirements of the higher classification. The Moderate nonattainment SIP submission deadlines, including the requirements for the DFW, HGB, and San Antonio Moderate areas, were established when the areas were reclassified from Marginal to Moderate—those deadlines were not challenged and they stand as finalized.

                     As noted earlier, comments addressing the Moderate nonattainment area submissions, with the exception of the Moderate attainment demonstration and the associated RACM and contingency measures for failure to attain by the Moderate attainment date, are outside the scope of this action.

                    While the EPA agrees that it must give legal effect to all parts of the statute, the CAA requirements for nonattainment areas are cumulative, adding more stringent requirements with each higher classification and building on the requirements of the lower classifications, and the EPA disagrees that this building of requirements always results in the lower classification requirements being superseded. As noted earlier, pursuant to CAA section 182(c), “each State in which all or part of a Serious Area is located shall, with respect to the Serious Area . . . make the submissions described under subsection (b) of this section (relating to Moderate Areas) and shall also submit the revisions to the applicable implementation plan (including the plan items) described under this subsection.” Except for elements specifically related to the attainment date, which are superseded by a voluntary reclassification, the higher classification requirements are added to the lower classification requirements. For example, although the Serious area major source threshold is more stringent than it is for a Moderate area, this does not supersede the NSR requirements for any source covered under the Moderate threshold. Instead, NSR requirements for smaller sources under the Serious threshold are 
                    <E T="03">in addition to</E>
                     those for sources covered under the Moderate threshold.

                    Our approach here is consistent with past actions to grant voluntary reclassifications. When Texas previously requested a voluntary reclassification for the HGB area from Moderate to Severe under the 1997 ozone NAAQS, we noted that, “Texas has a continuing responsibility for certain elements of the Moderate area requirements. EPA has stated that reclassification does not provide a basis for extending submission deadlines for SIP elements unrelated to the attainment demonstration that were due for the area's Moderate classification.”

                     The commenter states that, as an alternative to all Moderate classification requirements being mooted, the Moderate classification RFP contingency measure element could be mooted for areas where RFP targets have been met and requests clarification on how to demonstrate this element is no longer required. The commenter also cites 85 FR 40026, a proposed reclassification action in which EPA proposed to determine that contingency measures for RFP were no longer necessary for the prior Moderate classification nonattainment plan because the state had adequately demonstrated that the applicable quantitative milestones under the Moderate plan had been met.

                     The EPA acknowledges that in certain unideal situations, where the state has demonstrated that an RFP milestone has actually been met and where EPA has determined that demonstration to be adequate, the question of whether the state has adequate contingency measures for failure to meet RFP with respect to that milestone can be moot. This situation is unideal because the CAA is not designed to operate this way with respect to timing, and these situations typically arise because the state is overdue for submitting approvable contingency measures. Under normal CAA timelines, the contingency measures submittal and EPA approval should occur before the RFP milestone arrives so that the contingency measures could be triggered if the area failed to meet RFP. States should not delay submittal of required contingency submittals in the hopes that they may become moot at a later time. Such an approach contravenes the statutory timelines established by the CAA, and the intent of the contingency measures requirement. If this situation arises and the RFP milestone is not met, the CAA requires implementation of contingency measures without further action by the state or EPA. That requirement cannot be met on time if the contingency measures submittal is delayed.
                </P>
                <P>For these reasons, EPA made a finding of failure to submit for contingency measures triggered by failure to meet RFP for the Moderate ozone nonattainment areas at issue here (and other elements) in October 2023. That finding started sanctions and FIP clocks that are still running because these (and other elements) are still outstanding. With this voluntary reclassification, EPA also urges the timely submittal of all required elements for the Serious classification, including contingency measures for all Serious RFP milestones and for failure to attain by the Serious area attainment date.</P>
                <P>
                    Under unusual circumstances in which EPA determines the Moderate area RFP reduction target was met before the state makes its overdue submittal to satisfy the requirement for Moderate contingency measures for failure to meet RFP, the EPA believes that no submittal of contingency measures for Moderate area RFP would be necessary. We acknowledge the EPA took a similar position within a PM 
                    <E T="52">2.5</E>
                     action cited by the commenter and believe the same logic could apply here.
                </P>
                <P>
                    This situation is also somewhat similar to EPA's prior disapproval of contingency measures in Texas for the 2008 Ozone NAAQS where we stated that, “EPA agrees with TCEQ that there is no longer a need for contingency measures triggered by failure to meet RFP for the DFW and HGB Serious nonattainment plan for purposes of the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS, because these areas met RFP for this specific classification. However, contingency measures are still required for the failure to attain (and indeed, noting the fact that areas failed to attain, should already have taken effect).” 
                    <SU>31</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     There, the contingency measures were not needed for failure to meet RFP because EPA had previously determined that the area had met RFP, but contingency measures were still needed for failure to attain. But here, as explained previously, with this voluntary reclassification there will be no possibility of failure to attain by the Moderate area attainment date, and so the voluntary reclassification negates the need for contingency measures for failure to attain for the Moderate classification. Further, an RFP demonstration that EPA determined to be adequate would in this case negate the need to submit the Moderate contingency measures for failure to meet RFP, thus resulting in mooting the Moderate area contingency measures requirement entirely. Note, however, that the first Serious area RFP milestone is December 31, 2026, so a timely Serious area contingency measures submittal by January 1, 2026, is necessary to ensure that contingency measures are in place before the milestone occurs.

                    Finally, in response to the commenter's inquiry as to the appropriate mechanism for demonstrating that the Moderate RFP emission reduction targets have been met, the EPA notes that it does not have specific guidance or rules for this. Section 182(g) of the CAA does not require a milestone compliance demonstration (MCD) for Moderate areas. EPA expects that the process would work similar to that for PM (40 CFR 51.1013(b)) or for other MCDs for ozone (40 CFR 51.1310(c)(2)), where the state would provide to the EPA Regional Administrator a formal demonstration (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     from the Governor or designee) showing the basis for establishing that RFP was met. The contingency measures SIP submittal requirement for failure to meet RFP would not be mooted unless and until EPA formally responds with a determination that it is adequate. EPA encourages the state to work with the Regional Office to discuss the demonstration process further.

                     The TCEQ states that the EPA should allow states flexibility in meeting RFP requirements, especially in areas where states can demonstrate that required reductions would not advance attainment. The TCEQ states that RFP requirements for areas classified as Moderate nonattainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS are incredibly challenging to meet due to the significant reductions in ozone precursor emissions since 1990. The TCEQ states that as moderate classification RFP targets will still need to be demonstrated for the Bexar County nonattainment area under the Serious classification, EPA should allow states to substitute NO
                    <E T="52">X</E>
                     emissions reductions in place of the 15 percent reduction in VOC required for initially designated Moderate ozone nonattainment areas when NO
                    <E T="52">X</E>
                     emissions reductions are demonstrated to be at least as effective at reducing ozone concentrations. The TCEQ states that it recognizes that the CAA mandates the 15 percent VOC emissions reductions, but preliminary TCEQ photochemical modeling indicates that VOC reductions will not advance attainment of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in Bexar County. The TCEQ states that instead, this modeling indicates NO
                    <E T="52">X</E>
                     emissions reductions will be more effective at reducing ozone concentrations in Bexar County. The TCEQ states that in Bexar County, point sources account for less than 5 percent of the total anthropogenic VOC emissions, and that area sources (including emissions from consumer products) account for about 70 percent of anthropogenic VOC emissions. The TCEQ states that the EPA should not require states to develop regulations that are ineffective at reducing ozone, economically penalizing to consumers, difficult to enforce, and unlikely to achieve the required reductions. The TCEQ states that allowing states flexibility in this sphere (and others discussed herein) will further the CAA's cooperative federalism framework, ensure proper respect for the states' role in fulfilling their CAA obligations, and result in better outcomes consistent with the aims of the CAA.

Commenters mention that courts have deferred to EPA's decisions tying RACM to the statutory attainment deadlines and state that EPA has “authority to change its approach to RACM, so long as it “displays awareness that it is changing position, provides a reasoned explanation for the change, and is also cognizant of reliance interests on the agency's prior policy.”

                     We appreciate the information provided by the commenters. The EPA disagrees that RACM is required in this circumstance for the DFW, HGB, and San Antonio Moderate nonattainment areas. EPA has long interpreted the CAA requirement for ozone nonattainment areas to assess and implement reasonably available control measures to mean that states need to analyze and implement measures that advance an ozone area's attainment, and a measure is not RACM if it would not advance the attainment date (57 FR 13498, 13560).

In developing a SIP revision pursuant to the RACM requirement, a state must consider all potentially available measures to determine whether they are reasonably available for implementation in the area, and whether they would advance the area's attainment date. The state may reject any measures as not RACM if they would not advance the attainment date, would cause substantial widespread and long-term adverse impacts, or would be economically or technologically infeasible.

Following reclassification, such measures must be considered as Texas undertakes the required RACM analysis for the newly reclassified Serious areas, and Texas must evaluate these measures for their potential to advance the attainment date ahead of the otherwise applicable Serious date.

                     Commenters provide a wide range of recommendations, including “as expeditiously as possible” and that the SIP submission deadline be set at 12 months. Commenters also state that the 12-month SIP deadline based on CAA section 179(d) has no relevance to the current circumstance. Commenters state that a SIP deadline of 18 months or longer is consistent with CAA section 110(k)(5), allowing the EPA to establish reasonable deadlines. Commenters also state that the EPA should finalize a SIP submission deadline of 18 months or January 1, 2026, whichever is later.

                    One commenter (the TCEQ) urged the EPA to set a submittal deadline of at least 18 months from the effective date of reclassification, but no sooner than January 1, 2026. The TCEQ provided justification, citing the substantial amount of time to conduct modeling, evaluate controls, develop attainment plans, and conduct rulemaking while allowing affected sources sufficient time to implement control requirements. The TCEQ added that significant resources are required to address each of the three reclassified Serious nonattainment areas and expressed concern that an expedited SIP submittal deadline would reduce the time needed to prepare and submit approvable SIPs. The TCEQ also expressed the desire to incorporate on-road and non-road emission inventories 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51838"/>
                    in the Serious SIP revisions using the newly released version of the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES4) model, which would require significant work to develop inventories for multiple years and areas.

                     The EPA notes that the proposal pointed to CAA sections 179(d) and 110(k)(5) as examples of statutory provisions establishing timeframes for states to revise SIPs in instances where SIPs had been insufficient to result in an area's attainment by the attainment date and where SIPs had been identified as substantially inadequate to attain the NAAQS (among other things). To the extent that the commenter is asserting these provisions do not directly apply to the three areas being voluntarily reclassified, we agree. But we do not agree that the timing considerations of those provisions have no relevance to informing EPA's consideration and establishment of the SIP submission deadlines contemplated here. Here, as in the situation contemplated by CAA section 179(d), the areas in question would fail to timely attain by the Moderate area attainment date, absent the state's voluntary request to reclassify as Serious. Here, as in the situation contemplated by CAA section 110(k)(5), the state's SIPs have been inadequate to attain the NAAQS. So, while we agree that these provisions do not directly apply because EPA has not made the requisite findings to trigger those provisions, the Act's imposition of a 12-month clock, or an outer limit of no more than 18 months, for states to submit revisions addressing these conditions are informative of the appropriate timeframe to apply to these areas under these circumstances. It was therefore reasonable for EPA to propose a range of statutory timeframes for the SIP submission deadline that were in part informed by the relevant, though not directly applicable, statutory situations presented in CAA sections 179(d) and 110(k)(5).

                    We appreciate the information provided by the TCEQ. We are finalizing a SIP submission deadline of 18 months from the effective date of this action or January 1, 2026, whichever is earlier. As noted in the proposal, the 2026 ozone season, which in some areas begins on January 1, 2026, is the last ozone season that can impact air quality before the areas' attainment dates in 2027. We note that commenter's request that we establish a SIP submission deadline of “no sooner than January 1, 2026” appears to acknowledge the significance of that date with respect to the statutory and regulatory constraints on SIP submittal deadlines and implementation. Per EPA's 2015 ozone SRR, and as discussed below, states must implement RACT no later than the beginning of the ozone season of the attainment year, see 40 CFR 51.1312(a)(3), and it is appropriate to establish SIP deadlines no later than when the control measures in those SIPs are required to be implemented.

                     As discussed in the proposal, EPA's action establishing deadlines is informed by CAA section 182(i), which governs the adjustment of SIP revision deadlines following a mandatory reclassification for failure to timely attain by the attainment date. That provision instructs that the Administrator may adjust deadlines for meeting requirements associated with the reclassification, “to the extent such adjustment is necessary and appropriate to assure consistency among the required submissions.” CAA section 182(i). Given that the beginning of the attainment year ozone season for some of these areas is January 1, 2026 (and for the other two it is March 1) we are setting the maximum SIP submission deadline as no later than January 1, 2026, in order to assure consistency among all of the state's submissions.

In this case, given that a SIP revision deadline of 24 months from the effective date of reclassification would be

                <P>We are finalizing this more extended timeframe for submitting the Serious area requirements (as opposed to 12 months, which was also contemplated in the proposal), because we acknowledge, as raised by the commenter, the complexity in developing and implementing effective emission reductions for the areas, and the opportunity a longer timeframe provides for more robust attainment demonstration plans that include the newer MOVES modeling. Developing and implementing effective emission reductions for these areas is complex due to the complex coastal meteorology and large industrial area in the HGB area, and the large urban and growing populations in all three areas. With a SIP submission deadline of 18 months from the effective date of this action but no later than January 1, 2026, we believe the TCEQ will be able to use the best information available in its Serious SIP submissions, while ensuring that SIP elements requiring control measures needed for attainment are submitted no later than when those controls are required to be implemented.</P>

                     A commenter states that there is no way for RACT to be implemented sooner, or more expeditiously, than the latest date required by the CAA. Commenters state that the EPA should set implementation deadlines for RACT by area instead of imposing one blanket deadline. Commenters state that the EPA has inappropriately proposed the same RACT implementation deadline (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     January 1, 2026) for all three areas without considering the circumstances of each area. Commenters state that the different ozone seasons, historic frequency of ozone exceedances, emission sources, and timelines for emission control compliance support different implementation deadlines. Commenters state that the ozone season for the HGB nonattainment area begins on January 1, but the ozone season for the DFW and San Antonio nonattainment areas begins on March 1. Commenters state that implementing RACT at the start of the ozone season would not likely influence the design values as most of the highest ozone observations occur in May or later for all three areas. Commenters provide, as an example, “the HGB area has not measured an eight-hour ozone concentration greater than 70 ppb before March 1 for over 10 years so the requirement for RACT implementation by January 1, 2026, would not benefit the area's design value.” Commenters state that advancing attainment of the area is not a factor of consideration when evaluating RACT and therefore, it is not imperative that RACT be implemented by no later than the beginning of the attainment year ozone season; and it is inadequate support for requiring RACT implementation dates to be uniform for all nonattainment areas.

                    Commenters state that the EPA should finalize RACT implementation deadlines to allow affected entities to comply with RACT on a timeline that considers sources' ability to control emissions based on technological and economic feasibility, which are primary factors in determining RACT. Commenters state that the ability to control could vary between sources, source categories, and areas, particularly for Bexar County, and additional time may be needed to allow affected sources to comply with new rules. Commenters state that compliance may necessitate that affected sources purchase, install, test, and operate new equipment or control devices, and even if new

                    regulations only require affected sources to replace higher VOC-content materials with lower VOC-content materials, owners and operators would still need time to address existing stocks, find suppliers, and order new supplies.

                     We appreciate these comments. Texas is now required to submit SIP revisions to implement RACT level controls for all three nonattainment areas now classified as Serious, which includes a lower Serious area source threshold of a potential to emit 50 tpy or more down from the Moderate area level of 100 tpy.

                <P>
                    RACT-level controls should already be largely implemented in the DFW and HGB areas for sources within the Serious area source threshold, as these two areas were reclassified from Moderate to Serious for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, effective September 23, 2019, and the required RACT implementation deadlines were August 3, 2020, and July 20, 2021.

                    We appreciate the TCEQ's concerns regarding RACT in Bexar County. However, the implementation deadline for the Moderate area RACT was January 1, 2023, and by this time, implementation of RACT for the Moderate area should already be underway in the San Antonio area. Accordingly, most sources should already be under RACT controls for the Moderate classification and this voluntary reclassification as Serious will add those sources emitting less than 100 tpy that have the potential to emit 50 tpy or more. In addition, and as noted earlier, delays in implementing the more stringent requirements associated with reclassification would delay related air quality improvements and human health benefits for residents across the San Antonio nonattainment area, including those that may already bear a disproportionate burden of pollution, as shown in the EJ considerations referenced in our January 2024 proposal and included in the docket for this action. Therefore, consistent with our January 2024 proposal and the EPA's implementing regulations for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, for RACT required pursuant to reclassification we are finalizing the Serious RACT implementation deadline to be as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than the start of the attainment year ozone season associated with the area's new attainment deadline, which is March 1, 2026.

                    We also discussed in our January 2024 proposal that if the State wishes to rely upon emission reductions from any revisions to its I/M programs in SIPs demonstrating attainment or RFP, the State would need to fully implement these I/M program revisions as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the beginning of the applicable

                     January 1, 2026 for the HGB area and March 1, 2026 for the DFW and San Antonio areas. However, the EPA has long taken the position that, like VOC RACT, the statutory requirement for states to implement I/M in ozone nonattainment areas classified Moderate and higher generally exists independently from the attainment planning requirements for such areas.
                    <SU>49</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Thus, EPA believes that if the emission reductions from any I/M program revisions are not relied upon to demonstrate attainment by the attainment deadline or towards RFP for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, then an implementation deadline of no more than four years after the effective date of reclassification is reasonable given the unique nature of I/M programs and the many challenges, tasks, and milestones that must be met in implementing an Enhanced I/M program.

                    Furthermore, giving up to a four-year timeframe to implement Enhanced I/M in reclassified Serious nonattainment areas (that do not rely upon emission reductions from the new or revised Enhanced I/M programs for attainment demonstration or RFP SIP purposes) is consistent with the no more than four-year I/M implementation period established in the recent final rule that reclassified Marginal nonattainment areas to Moderate for the 2015 ozone NAAQS (which triggered requirements for Basic I/M programs).

                     The commenter disagrees that it is necessary to establish a January 1, 2026, implementation date for the Enhanced I/M program under the Serious classification in order to use the emissions reductions toward meeting Serious area attainment demonstration and RFP SIP obligations. The commenter states that the EPA has not provided a rationale for why newly required Enhanced I/M programs for the 2015 ozone standard would have to be fully implemented by no later than January 1, 2026, the beginning of the Serious classification attainment year. The commenter contends that if emissions reductions from implementation of an Enhanced I/M program can be used for meeting SIP requirements under the Serious classification, the reductions can be based on when the program starts within the attainment year. The commenter states that emissions reductions from I/M programs are variable, depending on the number of vehicles tested in any given month, the vehicles' emissions profiles, and state of repair.

                     We appreciate these comments. However, as mentioned in our proposal and the SRR for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, all control measures in the attainment plan and demonstration must be implemented no later than the beginning of the attainment year ozone season, notwithstanding any alternate RACT and/or RACM implementation deadline requirements in 40 CFR 51.1312 (see 40 CFR 51.1308(d) and 83 FR 62998). Therefore, for those areas intending to rely upon emissions reductions from any revisions to its I/M programs for the Serious attainment demonstration or RFP SIP purposes, it is necessary to establish an I/M implementation deadline of no later than the start of the attainment year ozone season.

                     The Office of the Harris County Attorney states that EPA provides an analysis of the HGB area's environmental justice (EJ) considerations in the proposed rule and notes that analyzing Harris County and its population with the inclusion of two other counties might not be the most accurate or effective way of understanding the EJ issues in Harris County. The commenter states that Harris County is geographically larger than Rhode Island, has a population larger than several states, is the third largest county in the United States, and has a sizable income gap. The commenter states that Harris County contains urban, suburban, and rural populations and does not have zoning laws, so commercial and industrial areas are often sited within or near residential areas, and consequently, neighborhoods in Harris County experience ozone pollution and EJ factors in different degrees. The commenter states that EPA noted this discrepancy in denying Texas's request for a 1-year extension of the attainment date for the HGB area for the 2008 ozone NAAQS—EPA based its denial, in part, on “considerations of existing pollution burdens for some communities within the area.”

                <P>Pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(3), we are granting the Texas Governor's request to voluntarily reclassify the San Antonio, DFW, and HGB nonattainment areas from Moderate to Serious for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The EPA is also finalizing a deadline of 18 months from the effective date of this action or January 1, 2026, whichever is earlier, for the TCEQ to submit SIP revisions addressing the CAA Serious ozone nonattainment area requirements for the San Antonio, DFW, and HGB areas. The Serious area requirements include Enhanced monitoring (CAA section 182(c)(1)); Emissions inventory and emissions statement rule (40 CFR 51.1300(p) and 40 CFR 51.1315); RFP (40 CFR 51.1310); Attainment demonstration and RACM (40 CFR 51.1308 and 40 CFR 51.1312(c)); RACT (40 CFR 51.1312); Nonattainment NSR (40 CFR 51.1314 and 40 CFR 51.165); Enhanced I/M (CAA section 182(c)(3) and 40 CFR 51 Subpart S); Clean-fuel vehicle programs (CAA section 182(c)(4); and Contingency measures (CAA sections 172(c)(9) and 182(c)(9)). In addition, a demonstration evaluating the need for a transportation control measure program (CAA section 182(c)(5)) is also required. We are also finalizing deadlines for implementation of new RACT controls: in the HGB area, implementation shall occur as expeditiously as practicable but no later than January 1, 2026, and in the San Antonio and DFW areas implementation shall occur as expeditiously as practicable but no later than March 1, 2026. We are also finalizing a deadline for any new or revised Enhanced I/M programs in the HGB area to be fully implemented as expeditiously as practicable but no later than January 1, 2026, if emission reductions from I/M program revisions are relied upon for attainment demonstration or RFP SIP purposes and no later than four years after the effective date of the final action reclassifying these areas as Serious for the 2015 ozone NAAQS if emission reductions from I/M program revisions are not relied upon for attainment demonstration or RFP SIP purposes. We are also finalizing a deadline for any new or revised Enhanced I/M programs in the San Antonio and DFW areas to be fully implemented as expeditiously as practicable but no later than March 1, 2026, if emission reductions from I/M program revisions are relied upon for attainment demonstration or RFP SIP purposes and no later than four years after the effective date of the final action reclassifying these areas as Serious for the 2015 ozone NAAQS if emission reductions from I/M program revisions are not relied upon for attainment demonstration or RFP SIP purposes. We are also finalizing a deadline for the first transportation control demonstration, as required by CAA section 182(c)(5), of no later than January 1, 2028, and for subsequent transportation control demonstrations every 3 years thereafter.</P>

                <P>
                    As stated in our January 2024 proposal and for informational purposes only, EPA conducted screening analyses of the San Antonio, DFW, and HGB areas using EPA's Environmental Justice (EJ) screening tool (EJScreen tool, version 2.2).

                     The results of this analysis are provided for informational and transparency purposes, not as a basis of our proposed action. The EJScreen analysis reports are available in the docket for this rulemaking. The EPA found, based on the EJScreen analyses, that this final action will not have disproportionately high or adverse human health or environmental effects on a particular group of people, because EPA's granting of the Texas Governor's request to reclassify the San Antonio, DFW, and HGB ozone nonattainment areas from Moderate to Serious will require ongoing reductions of ozone precursor emissions, as required by the CAA. Specifically, this final rule would require that Texas submit plans for each area including: Enhanced monitoring (CAA section 182(c)(1)); Emissions inventory and emissions statement rule (40 CFR 51.1300(p) and 40 CFR 51.1315); RFP (40 CFR 51.1310); Attainment demonstration and RACM (40 CFR 51.1308 and 40 CFR 51.1312(c)); RACT (40 CFR 51.1312); Nonattainment NSR (40 CFR 51.1314 and 40 CFR 51.165); Enhanced I/M (CAA section 182(c)(3) and 40 CFR 51 Subpart S); Clean-fuel vehicle programs (CAA section 182(c)(4); Contingency measures (CAA sections 172(c)(9) and 182(c)(9)); and a demonstration evaluating the need for a transportation control measure program (CAA section 182(c)(5)). These required measures would help to improve air quality in the affected nonattainment areas. Information on ozone and its relationship to negative health impacts can be found at

                <P>Executive Order 12898 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, 59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994) directs Federal agencies to identify and address “disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects” of their actions on minority populations and low-income populations to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law. The EPA defines environmental justice (EJ) as “the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.” The EPA further defines the term fair treatment to mean that “no group of people should bear a disproportionate burden of environmental harms and risks, including those resulting from the negative environmental consequences of industrial, governmental, and commercial operations or programs and policies.”</P>
                <P>This final action would reclassify the San Antonio, DFW, and HGB nonattainment areas from Moderate to Serious for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, set deadlines for the submission of revised SIPs addressing the Serious area requirements for these three nonattainment areas, and set deadlines for implementation of controls required for these three nonattainment areas. This final does not revise measures in the current SIP. As such, at a minimum, this action would not worsen any existing air quality and is expected to ensure the areas are meeting requirements to attain and/or maintain air quality standards. Further, there is no information in the record indicating this action is expected to have disproportionately high or adverse human health or environmental effects on a particular group of people. The EPA performed an environmental justice analysis, as described earlier in this action under “Environmental Justice Considerations.” The analysis was done for the purpose of providing additional context and information about this action to the public, not as a basis of the action.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">K. Congressional Review Act (CRA)</HD>
                <P>This final rule is exempt from the CRA because it is a rule of particular applicability. The rule makes factual determinations for specific entities and does not directly regulate any entities. The EPA's approval to grant the request to reclassify does not in itself create any new requirements beyond what is mandated by the CAA.</P>

Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)</P>

                    EPA, on its own initiative, in accordance with FFDCA sections 408(e) and 408(l
                    <E T="03">)</E>
                    (6) of, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e) and 346a(1)(6), is establishing a time-limited tolerance for residues of afidopyropen, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on strawberry at 0.3 parts per million (ppm). This time-limited tolerance expires on December 31, 2027.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Section 408(l)(6) of FFDCA requires EPA to establish a time-limited tolerance or exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for pesticide chemical residues in food that will result from the use of a pesticide under an emergency exemption granted by EPA under FIFRA section 18. Such tolerances can be established without providing notice or period for public comment. EPA does not intend for its actions on FIFRA section 18 related time-limited tolerances to set binding precedents for the application of FFDCA section 408 and the safety standard to other tolerances and exemptions. Section 408(e) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish a tolerance or an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance on its own initiative, 
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     without having received any petition from an outside party.
                </P>
                <P>Section 408(b)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish a tolerance (the legal limit for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food) only if EPA determines that the tolerance is “safe.” Section 408(b)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines “safe” to mean that “there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.” This includes exposure through drinking water and in residential settings but does not include occupational exposure. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA requires EPA to give special consideration to exposure of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to “ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue . . . .”</P>
                <P>Section 18 of FIFRA authorizes EPA to exempt any Federal or State agency from any provision of FIFRA, if EPA determines that “emergency conditions exist which require such exemption.” EPA has established regulations governing such emergency exemptions in 40 CFR part 166.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Emergency Exemption for Afidopyropen on Strawberry and FFDCA Tolerance</HD>
                <P>The California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) has requested a specific emergency exemption for use of afidopyropen in field-grown strawberry to control lygus bugs (Western Tarnished Plant Bugs). The applicant asserts that significant losses have occurred due to unprecedented infestations of lygus bugs in California strawberry, and an urgent and nonroutine situation is occurring. The applicant cites various factors leading to the current situation, including lack of commercially and environmentally viable alternative controls due to restrictions for using neonicotinoid pesticides, and ongoing resistance development to pyrethroid pesticides. Additionally, extreme wet conditions over the last several years have contributed to higher levels of weeds in nearby areas, hosting high populations of lygus bugs which then migrate to the neighboring strawberry fields. Despite the use of available controls, the applicant states that lygus bugs have not been adequately controlled and strawberry growers are facing significant economic losses without an effective control, such as the requested afidopyropen.</P>
                <P>After having reviewed the submission, EPA determined that an emergency condition exists for this State, and that the criteria for approval of an emergency exemption are met. EPA has authorized a specific exemption under FIFRA section 18 for the use of afidopyropen on field-grown strawberry for control of lygus bug in California.</P>
                <P>
                    As part of its evaluation of the emergency exemption application, EPA assessed the potential risks presented by residues of afidopyropen in or on strawberry. In doing so, EPA considered the safety standard in FFDCA section 408(b)(2), and EPA decided that the necessary tolerance under FFDCA section 408(l)(6) would be consistent with the safety standard and with FIFRA section 18. Consistent with the need to move quickly on the emergency exemption in order to address an urgent non-routine situation and to ensure that the resulting food is safe and lawful, EPA is issuing this tolerance without notice and opportunity for public comment as provided in FFDCA section 408(l)(6). Although this time-limited tolerance expires on December 31, 2027, under FFDCA section 408(l)(5), residues of the pesticide not in excess of the amount specified in the tolerance remaining in or on strawberry after that 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51845"/>
                    date will not be unlawful, provided the pesticide was applied in a manner that was lawful under FIFRA, and the residues do not exceed a level that was authorized by this time-limited tolerance at the time of that application. EPA will take action to revoke the time-limited tolerance earlier if any experience with, scientific data on, or other relevant information on this pesticide indicate that the residues are not safe.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Because this time-limited tolerance is being approved under emergency conditions, EPA has not made any decisions about whether afidopyropen meets FIFRA's registration requirements for use on field grown strawberry or whether a permanent tolerance for this use would be appropriate. Under these circumstances, EPA does not believe that this time-limited tolerance decision serves as a basis for registration of afidopyropen by a State for special local needs under FIFRA section 24(c). Nor does this tolerance by itself serve as the authority for persons in any State other than California to use this pesticide on field-grown strawberries under FIFRA section 18 absent the issuance of an emergency exemption applicable within that State.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Toxicological Points of Departure/Levels of Concern</HD>
                <P>
                    Once a pesticide's toxicological profile is determined, EPA identifies toxicological points of departure (POD) and levels of concern to use in evaluating the risk posed by human exposure to the pesticide. For hazards that have a threshold below which there is no appreciable risk, the toxicological POD is used as the basis for derivation of reference values for risk assessment. PODs are developed based on a careful analysis of the doses in each toxicological study to determine the dose at which no adverse effects are observed (the NOAEL) and the lowest dose at which adverse effects of concern are identified (the LOAEL). Uncertainty/safety factors are used in conjunction with the POD to calculate a safe exposure level—generally referred to as a population-adjusted dose (PAD) or a reference dose (RfD)—and a safe margin of exposure (MOE). For non-threshold risks, the Agency assumes that any amount of exposure will lead to some degree of risk. Thus, the Agency estimates risk in terms of the probability of an occurrence of the adverse effect expected in a lifetime. For more information on the general principles EPA uses in risk characterization and a complete description of the risk assessment process, see

                     Separate dietary exposure assessments were conducted for afidopyropen (acute and chronic) and the afidopyropen metabolite CPCA (chronic only) as the toxicological endpoints are different for these compounds. In evaluating dietary exposure to afidopyropen, EPA considered exposure under the time-limited tolerance established by this action as well as all existing afidopyropen tolerances in 40 CFR 180.700. EPA assessed dietary exposures from afidopyropen in food as follows:

                     In estimating acute dietary exposure (for afidopyropen only), EPA used food consumption information from the Dietary Exposure Evaluation Model-Food Commodity Intake Database (DEEM-FCID
                    <SU>TM</SU>
                    , Version 4.02), which incorporates 2005-2010 consumption data from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, What We Eat in America, (NHANES/WWEIA). The acute dietary assessment for afidopyropen was conducted using tolerance-level residues and 100% crop treated (PCT) assumptions. Empirical and default processing factors were also used. An acute dietary exposure assessment was not conducted for CPCA since an acute dietary endpoint was not identified.

                    <E T="03">Suggestive Evidence of Carcinogenic Potential.</E>
                    ” A cancer classification for CPCA has not been determined; however, a structural-activity relationship analysis indicated no structural alerts for genotoxicity or carcinogenicity. There were no reports of a tumorigenic response in the open literature. EPA determines whether quantitative cancer exposure and risk assessments are appropriate for a food-use pesticide based on the weight of the evidence from cancer studies and other relevant data. Cancer risk is quantified using a linear or nonlinear approach. If sufficient information on the carcinogenic mode of action is available, a threshold or nonlinear approach is used and a cancer RfD is calculated based on an earlier noncancer key event. If carcinogenic mode of action data are not available, or if the mode of action data determines a mutagenic mode of action, a default linear cancer slope factor approach is utilized. Based on the 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51846"/>
                    data referenced in Unit IV.A., EPA has concluded that a nonlinear RfD approach is appropriate for assessing cancer risk from afidopyropen. Quantification of risk using a non-linear approach (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     a cPAD) will adequately account for all chronic toxicity, including carcinogenicity, that could result from exposure to afidopyropen; the chronic aggregate assessments did not result in estimates of concern. Therefore, a separate cancer assessment was not conducted.

                    2. 
                    <E T="03">Dietary exposure from drinking water.</E>
                     The Agency used screening level water exposure models in the dietary exposure analysis and risk assessment for afidopyropen and CPCA in drinking water. These simulation models take into account data on the physical, chemical, and fate/transport characteristics of afidopyropen and CPCA. Further information regarding EPA drinking water models used in pesticide exposure assessment can be found at 
                    <E T="03">https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-science-and-assessing-pesticide-risks/models-pesticide-risk-assessment#aquatic.</E>
                </P>
                <P>Because of the difference in structure and mode of action, EPA calculated separate estimated drinking water concentrations (EDWCs) for afidopyropen and CPCA. Afidopyropen degrades in soil and water to form a wide range of structurally similar transformation products. All degradates, except CPCA, are included as residues of concern in the afidopyropen total toxic residues (TTR) analysis.</P>
                <P>The highest modeled EDWCs for afidopyropen and for CPCA used in the dietary risk assessments were entered directly into the latest version of the Pesticides in Water Calculator (PWC 1.52). EDWCs were calculated for both surface water and groundwater based on the maximum annual application rate (0.33 lb a.i./A). For afidopyropen, the highest EDWCs were for surface water. The surface water EDWCs used to assess contribution to dietary exposure and risks from drinking water were 7.1 ppb for the acute assessment and 3.9 ppb for the chronic and cancer assessments. For CPCA, an acute dietary risk assessment was not conducted since an acute dietary endpoint was not identified. For chronic dietary risk assessment, the highest EDWC for CPCA, that for groundwater of 35 ppb, was used for assessing the contribution to chronic dietary exposure through drinking water. These modeled estimates of drinking water concentrations were directly entered into the dietary exposure model.</P>

                     The term “residential exposure” is used in this document to refer to non-occupational, non-dietary exposure (

                    Afidopyropen is registered for use on residential ornamentals. Residential handler exposure is not expected because the pesticide is intended for commercial use and is not labelled for application by residential handlers. There is a potential for the registered and proposed uses to result in post-application dermal exposure to afidopyropen, due to activities in treated gardens. EPA aggregated the worst-case risk estimates from post-application exposures (

                     Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of FFDCA requires that, when considering whether to establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance, the Agency consider “available information” concerning the cumulative effects of a particular pesticide's residues and “other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity.”
                </P>
                <P>
                    EPA has not found afidopyropen or CPCA to share a common mechanism of toxicity with any other substances. Afidopyropen and another pesticide, aminocyclopyrachlor, both produce the toxic metabolite CPCA. Drinking water is the only expected exposure pathway for CPCA from both pesticides, and co-exposures to CPCA from both pesticides are unlikely to occur based on their use patterns. For the purposes of this tolerance action, therefore, EPA has concluded that it is not appropriate to conduct a cumulative exposure assessment.

                    <E T="03">In general.</E>
                     Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA provides that EPA shall apply an additional tenfold (10X) margin of safety for infants and children in the case of threshold effects to account for prenatal and postnatal toxicity and the completeness of the database on toxicity and exposure unless EPA determines based on reliable data that a different margin of safety will be safe for infants and children. This additional margin of safety is commonly referred to as the FQPA Safety Factor (SF). In applying this provision, EPA either retains the default value of 10X, or uses a different additional SF when reliable data available to EPA support the choice of a different factor.
                </P>
                <P>
                    2. 
                    <E T="03">Conclusion for afidopyropen.</E>
                     EPA has determined that reliable data show that the safety of infants and children would be adequately protected if the FQPA SF were reduced to 1X for all afidopyropen exposure scenarios. That decision is based on the following findings:
                </P>
                <P>i. The toxicity database for afidopyropen is considered complete for evaluating and characterizing toxicity, assessing children's susceptibility under FQPA, and selecting endpoints for the exposure pathways of concern.</P>
                <P>ii. Acute oral (gavage) and subchronic oral (dietary) neurotoxicity studies were conducted in rats with effects seen only in the acute study at the limit dose. In subchronic studies with mice and dogs, indications of neurotoxicity were limited to vacuolation of white matter and/or spinal cord, which may have been an artifact of not preparing the tissues properly. Further, the nervous tissue vacuolation was observed at doses 7.5x-115x higher than the POD for the chronic dietary risk assessment. Thus, the potential effects are well characterized with clearly established NOAEL/LOAEL values and the selected PODs are protective for the observed effects.</P>
                <P>
                    Based on the weight of the evidence and taking into consideration the PODs selected for risk assessment, a developmental neurotoxicity study is not required at this time. Clear NOAELs have been established for all life stages, the selected PODs are protective of all pre- and/or post-natal toxicity observed throughout the toxicology database, and no specific neuropathological effects were noted. A DNT with rat (the typical test species) would not be expected to contribute meaningfully to the database, as the rat is expected to be less sensitive than dogs and mice.
                    <PRTPAGE P="51847"/>
                </P>
                <P>iii. There is evidence of increased susceptibility following pre- and/or post-natal exposure to afidopyropen. Clear NOAELs have been established for the developmental effects in rats and rabbits as well as the offspring effects in the 2-generation reproduction studies. The NOAELs chosen for all selected endpoints are protective of all developmental and offspring effects seen in the database.</P>
                <P>iv. There are no residual uncertainties identified in the exposure databases. The dietary assessments were performed based on high-end assumptions such as 100% CT and tolerance-level residues, default processing factors, and modeled high-end estimates of residues in drinking water. All the exposure estimates are based on high-end assumptions and are not likely to underestimate risk. In addition, the residential exposure assessments for post-application exposures were conducted based on the Residential SOPs such that residential exposure and risk will not be underestimated. These assessments will not underestimate the exposure and risks posed by afidopyropen.</P>
                <P>
                    3. 
                    <E T="03">Conclusion for CPCA.</E>
                     No developmental or reproductive toxicity studies are available for CPCA to assess pre- and/or post-natal toxicity. EPA is therefore retaining the default FQPA safety factor of 10X to account for a subchronic to chronic duration extrapolation and the lack of data to assess developmental and reproductive toxicity of CPCA.
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Aggregate Risks and Determination of Safety</HD>
                <P>EPA determines whether acute and chronic dietary pesticide exposures are safe by comparing aggregate exposure estimates to the acute PAD (aPAD) and chronic PAD (cPAD). For linear cancer risks, EPA calculates the lifetime probability of acquiring cancer given the estimated aggregate exposure. Short-, intermediate-, and chronic-term risks are evaluated by comparing the estimated aggregate food, water, and residential exposure to the appropriate PODs to ensure that an adequate MOE exists. Separate dietary assessments were conducted for afidopyropen and its CPCA metabolite, as the toxicological endpoints are different for these compounds.</P>
                <P>
                    1. 
                    <E T="03">Acute risk.</E>
                     The acute aggregate risk assessment takes into account acute exposure estimates from dietary consumption of food and drinking water. An acute endpoint for afidopyropen was identified for females 13-49 years old. However, for all other population subgroups, including the overall U.S Population, no adverse effects for afidopyropen resulting from a single oral exposure was identified, no acute dietary endpoints were selected, and acute dietary exposure assessments were not conducted for these populations. Using the exposure assumptions discussed in this unit for acute exposure, the acute dietary exposure from food and water to afidopyropen will occupy 3.7% of the aPAD for females 13-49 years old (the only population subgroup for which an acute endpoint was identified), at the 95th percentile of exposure, and is below the level of concern (LOC) (&lt;100% of the aPAD). An acute dietary endpoint was not identified for CPCA; therefore, the Agency does not expect acute risk from exposure to CPCA.
                </P>
                <P>
                    2. 
                    <E T="03">Chronic risk.</E>
                     Using the exposure assumptions described in this unit for chronic exposure, the estimated chronic dietary exposure risks from food and water for afidopyropen and for CPCA are below the LOC (&lt;100% of the cPAD) for the US general population and all population subgroups. For afidopyropen, EPA has concluded that chronic exposure from food and water will utilize 6.4% of the cPAD for Children 1-2 years old, the population group receiving the greatest exposure, and 2.6% of the cPAD for the general U.S. population. For CPCA, EPA has concluded that chronic exposure from food and water will utilize 31% of the cPAD for Children 1-2 years old, the population group receiving the greatest exposure, and 11% of the cPAD for the general U.S population. Residential exposures to afidopyropen and CPCA are not expected to occur on a chronic basis. Therefore, the chronic aggregate risk estimates are equivalent to the chronic dietary risk estimates and are below the LOC.
                </P>
                <P>
                    3. 
                    <E T="03">Short-term risk.</E>
                     Short-term aggregate exposure takes into account short-term residential exposure plus chronic exposure to food and water (considered to be a background exposure level). Afidopyropen is currently registered for uses that could result in short-term residential exposure, and the Agency has determined that it is appropriate to aggregate chronic exposure through food and water with short-term residential exposures to afidopyropen.
                </P>
                <P>The short-term aggregate exposure assessment applies only to afidopyropen since residential exposure to CPCA is not expected. The short-term aggregate exposure assessment combines residential exposures for adults and children (6 to &lt;11 years old) contacting previously treated ornamentals) and average dietary (food + drinking water) exposures. EPA has concluded that the combined short-term aggregate exposures result in short term aggregate MOEs of 1,900 for adults and 2,100 for children. Because EPA's LOC for short term aggregate MOEs is 100 or below, these MOEs are not of concern.</P>
                <P>
                    4. 
                    <E T="03">Intermediate-term risk.</E>
                     Intermediate-term aggregate exposure takes into account intermediate-term non-dietary, non-occupational exposure plus chronic exposure to food and water (considered to be a background exposure level). Because no intermediate-term adverse effects were identified, afidopyropen and CPCA are not expected to pose an intermediate-term risk.
                </P>
                <P>
                    5. 
                    <E T="03">Aggregate cancer risk for U.S. population.</E>
                     As indicated in unit IV, afidopyropen is classified as having “suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity in humans.” Quantification of risk using a non-linear approach (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     a cPAD) will adequately account for all chronic toxicity, including carcinogenicity, that could result from exposure to afidopyropen, and the chronic aggregate assessment did not result in risk estimates of concern. A cancer classification for CPCA has not been determined; however, a structural-activity relationship analysis indicated no structural alerts for genotoxicity or carcinogenicity. There were no reports of a tumorigenic response in the open literature.
                </P>
                <P>
                    6. 
                    <E T="03">Determination of safety.</E>
                     Based on these risk assessments, EPA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the general population, or to infants and children, from aggregate exposure to afidopyropen and CPCA residues.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. International Residue Limits</HD>
                <P>In making its tolerance decisions, EPA seeks to harmonize U.S. tolerances with international standards whenever possible, consistent with U.S. food safety standards and agricultural practices. EPA considers the international maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(4). The Codex Alimentarius is a joint United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization food standards program, and it is recognized as an international food safety standards-setting organization in trade agreements to which the United States is a party. EPA may establish a tolerance that is different from a Codex MRL; however, FFDCA section 408(b)(4) requires that EPA explain the reasons for departing from the Codex level.</P>
                <P>The Codex has established an MRL for residues of afidopyropen in/on strawberry that harmonizes with the permanent U.S. tolerance established to support use in greenhouse-grown strawberry, both at 0.15 ppm. However, the time-limited tolerance established by this action of 0.3 ppm afidopyropen in/on strawberry is not harmonized with the Codex MRL. Based on available residue data, use by U.S. growers consistent with the approved emergency exemption use directions could result in residues that exceed the Codex MRL. Harmonizing with the Codex MRL could put U.S. growers at risk of violative residues despite legal use of afidopyropen. Moreover, EPA's regulations require adequate time-limited tolerances be in place in order to allow a pesticide use on food under an emergency exemption. A time-limited tolerance harmonized with the Codex MRL would not be adequate to cover residues resulting from the emergency exemption use in field-grown strawberry. Since EPA has determined that this time-limited tolerance is safe, EPA is establishing this time-limited tolerance despite the lack of harmonization with the related Codex MRL.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Conclusion</HD>
                <P>Therefore, a time-limited tolerance is established for residues of afidopyropen, in or on strawberry at 0.3 ppm. This tolerance expires on December 31, 2027.</P>

                    <P>The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposes to revise the regulations governing the inspection and certification for fresh fruits, vegetables, and other products by amending certain fees charged for Section 8e import inspections from a per-carlot basis to a per-pound basis, reducing the fee for each additional sublot by 50 percent, and establishing a new fee calculation for lots less than a carlot. These revisions are necessary to recover, as nearly as practicable, the costs of performing inspection services on imported commodities in accordance with the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.</P>

                <P>This document would amend regulations at 7 CFR part 51 issued under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621-1627), as amended.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14094</HD>
                <P>The USDA is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14094. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and promoting flexibility. Executive Order 14094 reaffirms, supplements, and updates Executive Order 12866 and further directs agencies to solicit and consider input from a wide range of affected and interested parties through a variety of means. This rule does not meet the criteria of a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866, as supplemented by Executive Order 13563 and updated by Executive Order 14094. Therefore, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has not reviewed this rule under those orders.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 13175</HD>
                <P>This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 13175—Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, which requires agencies to consider whether their rulemaking actions would have Tribal implications.</P>
                <P>AMS has determined that this proposed rule is unlikely to have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12988</HD>
                <P>This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform. This proposed action is not intended to have retroactive effect. There are no administrative procedures that must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
                <P>AMS is proposing to charge for certain Section 8e import inspections on a per-pound basis and make additional revisions to the fee structure of the Specialty Crop Inspection Division (Division). Accordingly, under this proposed rule, the fees for Section 8e import inspections for lots qualifying as a full carlot (or a whole lot) or for lots less than a full carlot would no longer be calculated on a per-carlot basis. Instead, those fees would be calculated on a per-pound rate basis. The proposed per-pound rate would be calculated by dividing the current inspection fee for a full carlot by the average weight by pound of a full carlot (40,000 pounds) (for example: the current inspection fee for a full carlot ($242) divided by 40,000 would result in a per-pound rate of $0.00605). The Division proposes to use 40,000 lbs. as the appropriate measurement for calculating the per-pound rate. AMS notes that 40,000 lbs. is generally recognized as the standard weight of the measurement used in USDA-AMS inspection practices when identifying a full carlot.</P>
                <P>
                    Additionally, AMS proposes to have two separate sublot fees: one for Section 8e sublots and one for non-Section 8e sublots. The term sublot is commonly used to describe additional lots of the same product. During an inspection, a sublot is generated when the product differs markedly, and such differences are associated with quality and/or condition, certain brands, varieties, sizes, or container markings. For an example, under this proposed rule, the fee for a Section 8e sublot would be reduced by 50 percent, from the current $110 per sublot fee (the FY 2024 rate) to $55 per sublot. All non-8e inspection fees would remain unchanged by this proposed rule. The proposed per-pound rate for a full carlot or for lots less than a full carlot, and the 8e sublot fee, would be subject to the annual updated Specialty Crops Program's inspections fee schedule.
                    <PRTPAGE P="51851"/>
                </P>
                <P>Under this proposed rule, for all Section 8e import inspections, AMS would apply the current lot separation and sampling rates at 7 CFR 51.2(d)(1-3). To calculate inspection fees for a full carlot, AMS would multiply the current per-pound rate, using the proposed calculation as noted above, by the total weight of the full carlot, plus any applicable sublot fees. To calculate the inspection fee for lots less than a carlot, AMS would multiply the current per-pound rate, using the proposed per-pound rate calculation as noted above, by the total weight of the lot, with a minimum charge equivalent to 2-hours computed at the current established hourly rate, whichever is greater, plus any sublot fee(s) as applicable.</P>
                <P>Currently, fees for all terminal market inspections, including Section 8e import inspections, are charged on a carlot basis (7 CFR 51.37). The current single carlot fee structure charges per conveyance and does not account for sampling and inspection time required for today's larger conveyances transporting larger volumes. The proposed per-pound fee structure will better ensure full recovery of inspection cost by AMS while mitigating the financial impact on applicants of additional sublot fees.</P>
                <P>As shown in Table 1, applicants importing typical 40,000-pound loads comprising one lot will see no change in inspection fees under this proposed rule. Table 2 shows that larger size loads, which typically require increased sampling and inspection, will see a proportional increase in fees under this proposed rule. However, loads currently subject to additional sublot fees will see a significant decrease in fees per sublot under this proposed rule. The proposed fee calculation change will more accurately assess fees on inspected volume, better aligning the Division's ability to ensure cost recovery while significantly reducing additional sublot fees charged to applicants. The following comparison of the Section 8e fee structure is based on FY 2024 fees. Any increase or decrease to Section 8e fees would be included in the annual fee structure package in subsequent years.</P>
                <P>Columns 1 and 2 of Table 1 compare the currently scheduled FY 2024 fee structure to the proposed new fee structure for a standard 40,000-pound lot. As shown in row 1, column 1, the currently scheduled FY 2024 fee structure for one lot is $242. Row 1, column 2 shows that under the proposed new fee structure, the fee for one lot would be unchanged at $242 but would be expressed at the per pound rate of $0.00605 (multiplied by 40,000 pounds).</P>
                <P>Column 1 (rows 2 through 5) shows that without the proposed new fee structure, the inspection fee for each additional 40,000-pound increases by $110. Column 2 shows that with the proposed new fee, the incremental cost per additional lot would be cut in half to $55. Column 3 shows the cost savings for additional lots.</P>

                         If the proposal in this rule does not go into effect, the FY 2024 inspection fee would be $242 for one 40,000-pound lot plus $110 for each additional lot. For FY 2023, the cost was $225 for the first 40,000-pound lot and $103 for each additional lot.

                         The proposed fee for one standard lot under this rule would be $242, unchanged from the FY 2024 fee, but would be expressed as the per-pound equivalent of $0.00605. ($242 inspection cost per 40,000-pound lot divided by 40,000 pounds equals $0.00605 per pound). Each additional lot would cost an additional $55, a 50% reduction from the FY 2024 incremental cost of $110 that would be in place without this rule change.

                <P>Table 2 shows the proposed new fee structure for alternative lot sizes. Row 2 shows again that the 40,000-pound lot fee would be unchanged at $242. Row 3 shows that for a 50,000-pound lot, the $302.50 inspection fee would be determined by multiplying the proposed per-pound rate ($0.00605) by 50,000 pounds. Row 1 shows that for any lot weighing less than 40,000 pounds, the applicable fee would be a 2-hour minimum charge at the currently established FY 2024 hourly inspection rate of $116 ($116 times 2 equals $232).</P>

                <P>
                    Prior to developing proposed revisions to the Section 8e fee structure, AMS engaged in discussions with State partners including Association of Fruit and Vegetable Inspection and Standardization Agencies (AFVISA) members and the Texas Cooperative Inspection Program (TCIP), as well as industry stakeholders. The outcome of 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51852"/>
                    these discussions was a positive perception of the fee changes as proposed.
                </P>
                <P>A 60-day comment period is provided for interested persons to submit comments on this proposed rule. A 60-day comment period is deemed appropriate because any change in fee calculations, if adopted, should be in place as soon as possible to move the program towards an adequate reserve and financial stability.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</HD>
                <P>Pursuant to the requirement set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), AMS has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. Accordingly, AMS provides this initial regulatory flexibility analysis. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesses subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.</P>
                <P>The proposed action described herein is being taken for several reasons, including that additional user fee revenues are needed to cover the costs of (1) providing current program operations and services; (2) improving the timeliness in which inspection services are provided; and (3) improving the work environment. AMS regularly reviews its user-fee financed programs to determine if the fees are adequate.</P>
                <P>This proposed rule would revise the regulations governing the inspection and certification for fresh fruits, vegetables, and other products by increasing certain fees charged for Section 8e import inspections on a per-pound basis. These revisions are necessary to recover, as nearly as practicable, the costs of performing inspection services on imported commodities in accordance with the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.</P>
                <P>Since the inspection fees to be charged under the proposed new rate structure are proportional to size of lots, smaller businesses (importers) would not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. This proposed new fee structure, for imports subject to Section 8e grading requirements, balances cost increases (for lots larger than 40,000 pounds) with cost decreases for additional sublots. The fee for a standard 40,000-pound lot would remain unchanged.</P>
                <P>Tables 3 and 4 show the estimated impacts on the nine Section 8e commodities affected by this proposed rule, using data from USDA's Compliance Enforcement Management System (CEMS) database, which lists the weight of each lot inspected over the three-year period FY 2021 through FY 2023. Table 3 puts the number of inspections into two categories: Column (1) shows the number of lots that weighed 40,000 pounds or less, and column (2) shows the number of lots that weighed more than 40,000 pounds. Column (3) presents the sum of columns (1) and (2). The last row of column (3) shows that the total number of inspections for the three-year period was 611,475.</P>

                    Table 4 shows that for all nine commodities combined, 77 percent of the inspections would have had equal or lower fees charged if the new fee structure had been in place. Twenty-three percent of the lots would have 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51853"/>
                    been subject to higher fees. Looking at individual years (not shown), the percentage of inspections representing lots weighing 40,000 pounds or less for FY 2021, FY 2022 and FY 2023 was 73, 75, and 80 percent, respectively. Therefore, for a large majority of annual inspections, the cost per individual inspection would have been the same or lower than with the fee system currently in place.
                </P>
                <P>
                    The impacts of the proposed revised fee structure vary significantly by commodity. Table 4 shows that for six of the nine commodities, at least two thirds of the lots inspected would have had equal or lower fees (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     lots weighing 40,000 pounds or less—avocadoes, grapes, tomatoes, grapefruit, filberts, potatoes) under the proposed fee structure. One commodity, onions, would have had the opposite result, with 25 percent of lots seeing lower fees, and 75 percent higher. This variation would be offset by the onion industry's prevalence of additional sublots in inspections. See Table 1—SCI 8e Inspection Fees for Standard 40,000 Pound Lot: Comparison of FY 2024 Fee to Proposed New Fee, Showing Reduced Cost for Additional Lots. For oranges and kiwifruit, the results were about even; slightly more than 50 percent of the lots weighed equal to or less than 40,000 pounds and, therefore, would have been subject to lower fees.
                </P>
                <P>
                    This analysis assumes that each lot is sampled and inspected independently. This may overstate the extent of higher fees because under the proposed new fee structure the cost declines for each additional sublot, as shown in Table 1. To the extent that the lots for which fees were charged in the CEMS database are actually sublots associated with an inspected lot from a particular importer, the value in Table 4, column (2) (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     for lots more than 40,000 pounds) overstates the percentage of lots that would have been subject to a higher fee.
                </P>
                <P>It is also important to note that certain commodities represented larger proportions of the lots inspected, as shown in columns (4) and (5) of Table 3. Just over 75 percent of the inspected lots were for avocadoes. Adding the next four commodities in terms of the magnitude of total inspections (onions, grapes, oranges, and kiwifruit) raises the cumulative percentage up to nearly 99 percent. Four commodities (tomatoes, grapefruit, filbert, and potatoes) represented about 1.3 percent of the total number of lots inspected.</P>
                <P>This analysis shows that the fee impacts vary by commodity, with smaller fees per inspected lot expected for eight of the nine commodities, suggesting that for a large majority of annual inspections the cost per individual inspection would be the same or lower than with the fee system that would otherwise be in place in FY 2024 and future years.</P>

                    <P>The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. (Embraer) Model EMB-505 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by analysis of the left-hand (LH) refreshment center and LH forward cabinet that identified the need for installing structural reinforcements. This proposed AD would require installing structural reinforcements as specified in an Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</P>

                <P>ANAC, which is the aviation authority for Brazil, has issued ANAC AD 2023-07-01, effective August 10, 2023, as corrected by ANAC Airworthiness Directive Errata, effective August 10, 2023 (ANAC AD 2023-07-01) (also referred to as the MCAI) to correct an unsafe condition on certain serial-numbered Embraer Model EMB-505 airplanes. The MCAI states that analysis identified that the LH refreshment center and LH forward cabinet might not withstand the loads expected for specific emergency landing conditions, which may cause the detachment of mass items and cause injuries to the airplane occupants. In addition, the MCAI includes errata to correct a printing error in the original English version of the MCAI. The MCAI requires installing structural reinforcements.</P>

                <P>
                    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD process, the FAA developed a process to use some civil aviation authority (CAA) ADs as the primary source of information for compliance with requirements for corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has been coordinating this process with manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, the FAA proposes to incorporate ANAC AD 2023-07-01 by reference in the FAA final rule. This proposed AD would, therefore, require compliance with ANAC AD 2023-07-01 in its entirety through that incorporation, except for any differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this proposed AD. Service information required by ANAC AD 2023-07-01 will be available at

                <P>The FAA has included all known costs in its cost estimate. According to the manufacturer, however, some or all of the costs of this proposed AD may be covered under warranty, thereby reducing the cost impact on affected operators.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
                <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
                <P>The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
                <P>The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
                <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
                <P>(1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866,</P>
                <P>(2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and</P>
                <P>(3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

                    <P>The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 767-200, -300, and -300F series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a main landing gear (MLG) collapse event following maintenance where a grinder was operating outside of its input parameters, resulting in possible heat damage to the outer cylinder of the MLG. This proposed AD would require replacing any affected outer cylinders. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</P>

                <P>
                    The FAA has received a report indicating that a Model 767 MLG involved in an MLG collapse event had its previous maintenance overhaul at a certain maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) facility. An investigation by the MRO indicated that a grinder used during maintenance activities was operating outside of its input parameters. The MRO identified 83 Model 767 MLG outer cylinders that had inner diameter grinding performed with the affected grinder, which could cause heat damage. This condition, if not addressed, could result in the inability of a principal structural element to sustain limit load, gear collapse resulting in loss of control and potential for off runway excursion, and deviation from the intended breakaway sequence potentially resulting in the spillage of fuel.

                <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
                <P>The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
                <P>The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
                <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
                <P>(1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866,</P>
                <P>(2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and</P>
                <P>(3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

                    <P>The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) (type certificate previously held by Turbomeca, S.A.) Model Makila 1A, Makila 1A1, and Makila 1A2 engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that the accumulated service life of certain critical parts was underestimated. This proposed AD would require determining the recalculated service life of certain critical parts, would require replacing the parts if necessary, and would also specify conditions for installing the parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
                <P>EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Union, has issued EASA AD 2023-0218, dated December 19, 2023 (EASA AD 2023-0218) (also referred to as the MCAI), to address an unsafe condition on Safran Model Makila 1A, Makila 1A1, and Makila 1A2 engines. The MCAI states that it has been determined that the accumulated service life of certain critical parts was underestimated. To address this potential unsafe condition, the manufacturer published service information that identifies the affected parts and provides instructions for recalculating the service life and replacing the affected parts. The MCAI specifies determining the recalculated service life of the affected parts and replacing if necessary. The MCAI also specifies conditions for installing the affected parts. This unsafe condition, if not addressed, could lead to operation of the affected parts beyond the part life, which could cause the failure of affected parts, possibly resulting in uncontained debris release with consequent damage to the helicopter and reduced control of the helicopter.</P>
                <P>
                    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at

                    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2023-0218, which specifies determining the recalculated service life of affected parts and replacing the affected parts, if necessary. EASA AD 2023-0218 also specifies conditions for installing the affected parts. This material is reasonably available because the interested parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by the means identified in the

                <P>These products have been approved by the aviation authority of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design Authority, it has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA is issuing this NPRM after determining that the unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed AD Requirements in This NPRM</HD>
                <P>This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions specified in EASA AD 2023-0218 described previously, except for any differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this AD.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Explanation of Required Compliance Information</HD>
                <P>
                    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD process, the FAA developed a process to use some civil aviation authority (CAA) ADs as the primary source of information for compliance with requirements for corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has since coordinated with other manufacturers and CAAs to use this process. As a result, the FAA proposes to incorporate by reference EASA AD 2023-0218 in the FAA final rule. This proposed AD would, therefore, require compliance with EASA AD 2023-0218 in its entirety through that incorporation, except for any differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this proposed AD. Using common terms that are the same as the heading of a particular section in the EASA AD does not mean that operators need comply only with that section. For example, where the AD requirement refers to “all required actions within the compliance times,” compliance with this AD requirement is not limited to the section titled “Required Action(s) and Compliance Time(s)” in EASA AD 2023-0218. Service information required by the EASA AD for compliance will be available at 
                    <E T="03">regulations.gov</E>
                     under Docket No. FAA-2024-1691 after the FAA final rule is published.

                <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
                <P>The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
                <P>The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
                <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
                <P>(1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866,</P>
                <P>(2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and</P>
                <P>(3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

                    <P>The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company (Boeing) Model 747-100, 747-100B, 747-100B SUD, 747-200B, 747-200C, 747-200F, 747-300, 747-400, 747-400D, 747-400F, 747SP, and 747SR series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of improper inner diameter grinding of landing gear outer cylinders, resulting in possible heat damage to the outer cylinder of the nose landing gear (NLG), body landing gear (BLG), and wing landing gear (WLG). This proposed AD would require replacing any affected outer cylinders. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</P>

                <P>
                    The FAA has received a report of a main landing gear collapse event on a Boeing Model 767 airplane that was last overhauled at a maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) facility. The MRO facility identified a grinder that was operating outside of its input parameters, which could cause heat 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51862"/>
                    damage to the outer cylinder of the NLG, BLG, and WLG. The MRO facility identified 67 Boeing Model 747 landing gear outer cylinders which had inner diameter grinding performed with the suspect grinder. This condition, if not addressed, could cause the failure of a principal structural element to sustain its limit load or collapse of the landing gear, which may result in loss of control of the airplane or a runway departure. A failure of an outer cylinder could also deviate from the intended breakaway sequence, which could result in a failed part impacting the fuel tank and spilling fuel and consequently creating a fire hazard.

                <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
                <P>The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
                <P>The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
                <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
                <P>(1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866,</P>
                <P>(2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and</P>
                <P>(3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

                    <P>This AD was prompted by a report of improper inner diameter grinding of landing gear outer cylinders, resulting in possible heat damage to the outer cylinder of the nose landing gear (NLG), body landing gear (BLG), and wing landing gear (WLG). The FAA is issuing this AD to address heat damage to the outer cylinder of the NLG, BLG, and WLG. The unsafe condition, if not addressed, could cause failure of a principal structural element to sustain its limit load or collapse of the landing gear, which may result in loss of control of the airplane or a runway departure.</P>

                        We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce findings that three species are not warranted for listing as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that it is not warranted at this time to list the Kiamichi crayfish (
                        <E T="03">Faxonius saxatilis</E>
                        ), Rio Grande chub (

                <P>
                    Section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and the implementing regulations at part 424 of title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR part 424) set forth procedures for adding species to, removing species from, or reclassifying species on the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants (Lists). The Act defines “species” as including any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants, and any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature. The Act defines “endangered species” as any species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range (16 U.S.C. 1532(6)), and “threatened species” as any species that is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range (16 U.S.C. 1532(20)). Under section 4(a)(1) of the Act, a species may be determined to be an endangered 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51865"/>
                    species or a threatened species because of any of the following five factors:
                </P>
                <P>(A) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;</P>
                <P>(B) Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;</P>
                <P>(C) Disease or predation;</P>
                <P>(D) The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or</P>
                <P>(E) Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</P>
                <P>These factors represent broad categories of natural or human-caused actions or conditions that could have an effect on a species' continued existence. In evaluating these actions and conditions, we look for those that may have a negative effect on individuals of the species, as well as other actions or conditions that may ameliorate any negative effects or may have positive effects.</P>
                <P>We use the term “threat” to refer in general to actions or conditions that are known to or are reasonably likely to negatively affect individuals of a species. The term “threat” includes actions or conditions that have a direct impact on individuals (direct impacts), as well as those that affect individuals through alteration of their habitat or required resources (stressors). The term “threat” may encompass—either together or separately—the source of the action or condition or the action or condition itself. However, the mere identification of any threat(s) does not necessarily mean that the species meets the statutory definition of an “endangered species” or a “threatened species.” In determining whether a species meets either definition, we must evaluate all identified threats by considering the expected response by the species, and the effects of the threats—in light of those actions and conditions that will ameliorate the threats—on an individual, population, and species level. We evaluate each threat and its expected effects on the species, then analyze the cumulative effect of all of the threats on the species as a whole. We also consider the cumulative effect of the threats in light of those actions and conditions that will have positive effects on the species, such as any existing regulatory mechanisms or conservation efforts. The Secretary of the Interior determines whether the species meets the Act's definition of an “endangered species” or a “threatened species” only after conducting this cumulative analysis and describing the expected effect on the species now and in the foreseeable future.</P>
                <P>
                    The Act does not define the term “foreseeable future,” which appears in the statutory definition of “threatened species.” Our implementing regulations at 50 CFR 424.11(d) set forth a framework for evaluating the foreseeable future on a case-by-case basis, which is further described in the 2009 Memorandum Opinion on the foreseeable future from the Department of the Interior, Office of the Solicitor (M-37021, January 16, 2009; “M-Opinion,” available online at 
                    <E T="03">https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.opengov.ibmcloud.com/files/uploads/M-37021.pdf</E>
                    ). The foreseeable future extends as far into the future as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service can make reasonably reliable predictions about the threats to the species and the species' responses to those threats. We need not identify the foreseeable future in terms of a specific period of time. We will describe the foreseeable future on a case-by-case basis, using the best available data and taking into account considerations such as the species' life-history characteristics, threat projection timeframes, and environmental variability. In other words, the foreseeable future is the period of time over which we can make reasonably reliable predictions. “Reliable” does not mean “certain”; it means sufficient to provide a reasonable degree of confidence in the prediction, in light of the conservation purposes of the Act.

                <P>In conducting our evaluation of the five factors provided in section 4(a)(1) of the Act to determine whether the Kiamichi crayfish, Rio Grande chub, and Rio Grande sucker meet the Act's definition of “endangered species” or “threatened species,” we considered and thoroughly evaluated the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future stressors and threats.

                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Finding</HD>
                <P>
                    The Kiamichi crayfish is a small crayfish, olive-brown to reddish-brown dorsally and mostly whitish ventrally. It is distinguished morphologically from other crayfish species by details of its coloration and by structural features of sexually mature males. It also has been confirmed to be a distinct species through genetic analysis. The species was first described as 
                    <E T="03">Orconectes saxatilis,</E>
                     but, based on phylogenetic analyses, the genus name was changed in 2017 to 
                    <E T="03">Faxonius</E>
                     and that remains the currently accepted genus. The Kiamichi crayfish historically and currently inhabits the headwaters and larger tributaries of the upper Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma. The species has been found only upstream of the community of Whitesboro in Le Flore County, Oklahoma.
                </P>
                <P>
                    The Kiamichi crayfish occurs in streams with substrate that is 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51866"/>
                    predominantly cobble, boulders, gravel, and other coarse rock. The species prefers riffle habitats but will shift to pool habitats during dry periods. The species needs stable riffles and pools, sufficient water quality, and sufficient water availability.
                </P>
                <P>We have carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats to the Kiamichi crayfish, and we evaluated all relevant factors under the five listing factors, including any regulatory mechanisms and conservation measures addressing these threats. The primary threats to the Kiamichi crayfish include water quality degradation and increases in water temperatures. Water quality degradation caused by low pH levels and elevated levels of heavy metals may be partially natural, and conditions may be improving based on current trends. Currently, water temperatures are within suitable temperature ranges for stream crayfish species (26-27 degrees Celsius (°C) [78.8-80.6 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)] and support all life stages of the Kiamichi crayfish with no negative effects. However, future climate projections used in concert with established relationships between air temperature and water temperature indicate that water temperatures are likely to increase progressively in the future.</P>
                <P>
                    Currently, the species occupies four analysis units and the entire historical range. In general, streamflow does not differ significantly from historical conditions, and the majority of the Kiamichi crayfish range is on protected lands and is in a condition that supports resiliency of the species. The species has tolerated impaired water quality conditions for multiple decades, including lower pH levels and elevated heavy metals that may be at least partially natural. Currently, three analysis units are moderately resilient, and one is highly resilient, which we consider sufficient to provide redundancy for the species. In addition, the Kiamichi crayfish has sufficient representation because it has survived through periods of intensive logging and drought, has adapted to tolerate drought conditions, and has had no change in its range. Therefore, the threats appear to have low imminence and magnitude such that they are not currently having a significant effect on the species' current viability. Thus, after assessing the best available information, we conclude that the Kiamichi crayfish is not in danger of extinction throughout all of its range (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     endangered).
                </P>
                <P>
                    Thus, we proceed with determining whether the species is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all of its range (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     threatened). In our projected timeframe of 50 years (2070), streamflow, landscape condition, pH and heavy metal levels are not expected to change significantly from the current condition in either of two scenarios that we evaluated. In fact, pH and heavy metal levels may improve for the Kiamichi crayfish in the future.
                </P>
                <P>The primary threat considered to have a potentially significant effect on the Kiamichi crayfish is increased water temperatures due to climate change. Using processes set forth by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we evaluated the Kiamichi crayfish under two future Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios: Under scenario 1 (RCP 4.5), water temperatures do not rise to a level that would be negative for the species; under scenario 2 (RCP 8.5), summer water temperatures rise to levels that may negatively affect the Kiamichi crayfish periodically. However, potentially suboptimal water temperatures are projected to be periodic during summer months only, and the species is adapted to periods of drought and higher temperatures. Because the Kiamichi crayfish has the ability to tolerate drought and higher temperatures by burrowing and moving to pools, the species is expected to be able to tolerate these times of higher projected water temperatures. Overall increasing water temperatures may affect the species in the future, but each analysis unit will remain in the same overall resiliency condition as the current condition because of the species' ability to modify behavior. Therefore, we anticipate redundancy and representation to remain similar to current conditions into the future. After assessing the best available information, we conclude that the Kiamichi crayfish is not likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all of its range.</P>
                <P>We also evaluated whether the Kiamichi crayfish is endangered or threatened in a significant portion of its range. We did not find any portions of the Kiamichi crayfish's range for which both (1) the portion is significant, and (2) the species is in danger of extinction in that portion, either now or within the foreseeable future. Thus, after assessing the best available information, we conclude that the Kiamichi crayfish is not in danger of extinction in a significant portion of its range now, or within the foreseeable future.</P>
                <P>
                    After assessing the best available information, we conclude that the Kiamichi crayfish is not in danger of extinction or likely to become in danger of extinction throughout all of its range or in any significant portion of its range. Therefore, we find that listing the Kiamichi crayfish as an endangered species or threatened species under the Act is not warranted. A detailed discussion of the basis for this finding can be found in the species assessment form and other supporting documents, which are available on

                    On September 27, 2013, we received a petition from WildEarth Guardians to list the Rio Grande chub (
                    <E T="03">Gila Pandora</E>
                    ) as an endangered or threatened species under the Act and designate critical habitat.

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Finding</HD>
                <P>The Rio Grande chub is a small freshwater fish found predominantly in montane stream environments in the upper Rio Grande basin in north-central New Mexico and south-central Colorado. Its range also includes portions of the Canadian River basin in New Mexico and the Pecos River basin in New Mexico and Texas. Another population may exist in the State of Coahuila, Mexico. The Rio Grande chub now occupies a small portion of its historical range in fragmented populations.</P>
                <P>
                    Found in a variety of aquatic habitats, the Rio Grande chub is associated with low gradient streams that may 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51867"/>
                    experience substantial variation in annual environmental conditions. Streams occupied by this species tend to have low to moderate water flow, low water depths, and a large temperature range. Like other chub species, the Rio Grande chub is often associated with instream structures. As omnivorous mid-water column feeders, the Rio Grande chub consumes drifting invertebrates, fish, and occasional vegetation.
                </P>
                <P>We have carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats to the Rio Grande chub, and we evaluated all relevant factors under the five listing factors, including any regulatory mechanisms and conservation measures addressing these threats. The primary threats affecting the Rio Grande chub's biological status include predation and competition from nonnative species, habitat loss and fragmentation caused by altered hydrology, catastrophic wildfire, and changes in environmental conditions due to climate change.</P>
                <P>
                    We estimated the risk of extirpation for each Rio Grande chub population over several time frames. The threats we considered include catastrophic wildfire, nonnative species, and water withdrawal due to surface water diversion and/or groundwater pumping. There were three categories of risk: high, medium, and low. These categories were defined by the likelihood of the threat occurring and the magnitude of its impact on the population. High risk meant the threat was likely (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     greater than 50 percent) to occur over the given timeframe and the magnitude to the population was severe, potentially resulting in extirpation. Low risk meant a threat had a remote probability (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     less than 10 percent) of occurring and the magnitude would be minimal. For medium risk populations, either the threat was unlikely (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     less than 50 percent) to occur or the magnitude of impact was projected to be moderate, meaning there could be population declines but total extirpation was unlikely. First, we assessed the risk of extirpation for each population over the next 10 years based on the current habitat and demographic characteristics of each population. Since conditions are expected to change in the future, we next considered two future time steps: mid-century (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     2050) and late-century (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     2099). These projections incorporated the effects of changes in environmental conditions under two climate change scenarios.
                </P>
                <P>
                    There are 53 populations of Rio Grande chub in the United States, which combined occupy 844 kilometers (km) (524.4 miles (mi)) of stream length. About 34 percent of these populations are at high risk of extirpation over the next 10 years. Most populations (57 percent) are at a medium risk of extirpation, with only 9 percent of populations at low risk. This risk of extirpation was primarily driven by nonnative species. No populations were at risk of extirpation due to stream dewatering and none were at high risk of extirpation due to wildfire over the next 10 years. Threats appear to have low imminence and magnitude such that they are not currently having a significant effect on the species' current viability. These 53 populations are distributed across a wide geographic area, providing redundancy from catastrophic events. They also occur across a range of environmental gradients, indicating the retention of adaptive capacity (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     representation). Thus, after assessing the best available information, we conclude that the Rio Grande chub is not in danger of extinction throughout all of its range (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     endangered).
                </P>
                <P>We then assessed whether extirpation risk as well as resiliency, redundancy, and representation would change over time. For resiliency, we modelled future changes in habitat suitability under two future Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Then we incorporated these changes in our estimation of future risk of extirpation for each population. Although the general trend was a decrease in habitat suitability over time, most populations (75 percent) are projected to have no changes in resiliency. There was little projected change in extirpation risk by mid- and late-century. Most populations continue to be at medium risk of extirpation, although the risks posed by wildfire did increase over time for some populations. Although changes in redundancy and representation are anticipated should high risk populations be extirpated, the low and moderate risk populations will continue to be distributed across the species range, conferring redundancy and representation. After assessing the best available information, we conclude that the species is not likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all of its range.</P>
                <P>
                    We also evaluated whether the Rio Grande chub is endangered or threatened in a significant portion of its range. We did not find any portions of the Rio Grande chub's range for which both (1) the portion is significant, and (2) the species is in danger of extinction in that portion, either now or within the foreseeable future. Thus, after assessing the best available information, we conclude that the Rio Grande chub is not in danger of extinction in a significant portion of its range now, or within the foreseeable future. After assessing the best available information, we conclude that the Rio Grande chub is not in danger of extinction or likely to become in danger of extinction throughout all of its range or in any significant portion of its range. Therefore, we find that listing the Rio Grande chub as an endangered species or threatened species under the Act is not warranted.

                    The Rio Grande sucker is a small freshwater fish found predominantly in montane stream environments in the upper Rio Grande basin in north-central 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51868"/>
                    New Mexico and south-central Colorado. Its historical range in the United States also includes portions of the Gila, Pecos, and Mimbres Rivers basins. The described range of the Rio Grande sucker also extends into several drainage basins in northern Chihuahua, Mexico.
                </P>
                <P>Found in a variety of aquatic habitats, the Rio Grande sucker is associated with low gradient streams that may experience substantial variation in environmental conditions annually. Streams occupied by this species tend to have low to moderate water flow, low water depths, and a large temperature range.

                <P>We have carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats to the Rio Grande sucker, and we evaluated all relevant factors under the five listing factors, including any regulatory mechanisms and conservation measures addressing these threats.

                </P>
                <P>
                    There are currently 32 populations of Rio Grande sucker in the United States, which combined occupy 605.7 km (376.4 mi) of stream length. About 38 percent of these populations are at high risk of extirpation over the next 10 years. Most populations (56 percent) are at a medium risk of extirpation, with 6 percent at low risk. The risk of extirpation was primarily driven by nonnative species. Over the next 10 years, two populations were at risk of extirpation due to stream dewatering and none were at high risk of extirpation due to wildfire. There was little projected change in risk by mid- and late-century. Most populations continue to be at medium risk of extirpation, although the risks posed by wildfire did increase over time for some populations. Levels of risk were mostly consistent across the range of the species: across drainages basins, most populations were at an overall medium risk of extirpation across time steps and scenarios. Threats appear to have low imminence and magnitude such that they are not currently having a significant effect on the species' current viability. These 32 populations are distributed across a wide geographic area, providing redundancy from catastrophic events. They also occur across a range of environmental gradients, indicating the retention of adaptive capacity (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     representation). Populations also occur in Mexico and there is suitable habitat present in basins where it has been found. Thus, after assessing the best available information, we conclude that the Rio Grande sucker is not in danger of extinction throughout all of its range (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     endangered).
                </P>
                <P>We then assessed whether extirpation risk as well as resiliency, redundancy, and representation would change over time. To inform future resiliency, we modelled future changes in habitat suitability under two future RCP scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Then we incorporated these changes in our estimation of future risk of extirpation for each population. Although the general trend was a decrease in habitat suitability over time, most populations (69 percent) are projected to have no changes in resiliency. Similar patterns of habitat change were projected for portions of the range in Mexico. Although changes in redundancy and representation are anticipated should high risk populations be extirpated, the low and moderate risk populations will continue to be distributed across the species range, conferring redundancy and representation. After assessing the best available information, we conclude that the species is not likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all of its range.</P>

                     Revision of a currently approved information collection.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Abstract:</E>
                     USDA Trade Missions and Trade Shows is revising previously approved surveys in order to gather more useful information to further program objectives. The updated surveys have more focused questions to prompt responses that will be used to implement effective trade promotion events and ensure that program objectives are met. For example, the updated surveys will now ask fewer qualitative questions about how participants felt during the event and more questions relating to the type of organizations participating in the program (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     whether an organization is a member of a USDA Cooperator or State and Region Trade Group). The surveys will collect relevant data on each organization and their connection to USDA initiatives and programs.
                </P>
                <P>Two of the five surveys undergoing revision are applications to gather essential information from respondents desiring to participate in USDA trade missions or virtual trade events to determine their eligibility to take part in the event. The remaining three are voluntary post-event digital surveys for participants to fill out after a USDA-endorsed trade show, trade mission, or virtual trade event to report their satisfaction with the event and actual on-site and projected sales data as a direct result of their participation in the program. Trade and sales data supplied on this form is strictly confidential and will not be shared with outside sources. Submitted information from these post-event surveys is used to measure the benefits of these activities for participants, participant satisfaction with the activities, and how activities can be improved. All revised surveys are expected to positively contribute to FAS' strategic goals related to promoting U.S. agricultural exports.</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Estimate of Burden:</E>
                     The total number of questions in each revised survey have decreased, resulting in the public reporting burden for each respondent participating in USDA Trade Mission and Shows Events to be approximately 15 minutes for each survey.

                     The 2001 National Defense Authorization Act contains specific sections addressing patient safety in military and veterans' health care systems. This legislation states that the Secretary of Defense shall establish a patient care error reporting and management system to study occurrences of errors in patient care and that one purpose of the system should be to “identify systemic factors that are associated with such occurrences” and “to provide for action to be taken to correct the identified systemic factors” (sec. 754, items b2 and b3). In addition, the legislation states that the Secretary shall “continue research and development investments to improve communication, coordination, and teamwork in the provision of health care” (Sec. 754, item d4). In its ongoing response to this legislation and in support of its mission to “promote a culture of safety to eliminate preventable patient harm by engaging, educating and equipping patient-care teams to institutionalize evidence-based safe practices,” the DoD Patient Safety Program plans to field the DoD Patient Safety Culture Survey. The Culture Survey is based on the Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's validated survey instrument. The survey obtains Military Health System staff opinions on patient safety issues such as teamwork, communications, medical error occurrence and response, error reporting, and overall perceptions of patient safety.

                     The Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act amended Title 10, United States Code by adding Section 1554a. That provision of law directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a board of review to review the disability determinations of covered individuals by Physical Evaluation Boards. Covered individuals are members and former members of the armed forces who, during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on December 31, 2009, were (1) separated from the armed forces due to unfitness for duty due to a medical condition with a disability rating of 20 percent disabled or less; and (2) are found to be not eligible for retirement. On June 27, 2008, The Department of Defense published DoDI 6040.44, which provides the guidance for this process.

                    <E T="03">Background:</E>
                     The MTG hurricane and storm damage risk reduction project is a levee system located approximately 60 miles southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana and includes most of Terrebonne Parish and a portion of Lafourche Parish between the Terrebonne Parish eastern boundary and 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51876"/>
                    Bayou Lafourche. The purpose of this project is to reduce the risk of damage caused by hurricane storm surges. A review of the project is needed because of the increasing susceptibility of coastal communities to storm surge due to wetland loss, sea level rise, and subsidence. The MTG Project was initially authorized by Section 1001(24) of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-114) in accordance with the Reports of the Chief of Engineers dated 23 August 2002 and 22 July 2003, at a total cost of $886.7 million. The project was redesigned in the 2013 Integrated RPEIS and PACR Report, both to address the project cost increase beyond the statutory limitation in accordance with Section 902 of the WRDA of 1986, as amended, and to meet updated post-Hurricane Katrina design guidelines. The MTG Project was subsequently re-authorized by Section 7002(3)5 of the WRRDA of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-121) in accordance with the Report of the Chief of Engineers dated 8 July 2013, at an updated total cost of $10,265,100,000. The MTG project was authorized to provide the 1% AEP level of hurricane and storm damage risk reduction while maintaining navigational passage and tidal exchange. The project consists of approximately 98 miles of levee including associated navigation, roadway, pump station fronting protection, and environmental control structures. The 2013 RPEIS provided an assessment for both programmatic and constructible features for the MTG project. Constructible features consisted of those project features that were determined to have sufficient design details to be constructed. Constructible features included levee reaches F1, F2, G1; the HNC Lock; and the Bayou Grand Caillou Floodgate. The remaining features were designed to a programmatic design level that would require supplemental National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation prior to construction. The mitigation plan for the constructible features included restoration of 427 acres of intermediate marsh, 358 acres of brackish marsh and 975 acres of saline marsh.
                </P>
                <P>This SEIS will disclose the context and intensity of environmental impacts, including indirect and cumulative effects, for the final array of levee alignments and associated features. Any required mitigation will also be discussed.</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Alternatives:</E>
                     The SEIS will evaluate the PACR alignment as identified in the 2013 Integrated RPEIS and PACR Report to include a reasonable range of alignment modifications that considers existing levee alignments, the least environmental damaging preferred alignment maximizing avoidance and minimization measures to sensitive habitats as well as the no action alternative. Major Features of the project include: (1) Approximately 98 miles of earthen levee, with final levee elevations ranging from 15 feet to 26.0 feet North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD88) plus overbuild and final levee widths from approximately 146 to 446 feet; (2) The Houma Navigation Canal lock complex (HNC Lock) with lock sill depth of −18 feet; (3) Construction on navigable waterways of 21 other floodgates such as stop log gates, barge gates, and sector gates; (4) Environmental water control structures at numerous locations within the levee system. Each control structure would consist of one or more culverts with gates that allow for tidal exchange; (5) Measures to offset the potential for increased water levels on the existing Larose to Golden Meadow project.

                <P>
                    <E T="03">Summary of Expected Effects:</E>
                     The SEIS will analyze the potential impacts on the human and natural environment resulting from the proposed actions for the Project. The scoping, public involvement, and interagency coordination processes are requesting data and information to help identify and define the range of potential significant issues that will be considered. Resources and issues that may be significantly impacted may include tidal wetlands and other waters of the U.S.; aquatic resources; essential fish habitat; threatened and endangered species and their critical habitats; cultural resources; soils; navigation and navigable waters; transportation and traffic; hydrology and hydraulics; induced flooding; environmental justice; and cumulative effects of related projects in the regional area.

                     final regulations for 34 CFR part 462, Measuring Educational Gain in the National Reporting System for Adult Education (73 FR 2305, January 14, 2008, as amended at 81 FR 55552, August 19, 2016) (NRS regulations). The NRS regulations established the process the Secretary uses to determine the suitability of tests for use in the NRS by States and local eligible providers. We annually publish in the

                     (85 FR 47952) an annual notice consolidating information from previous notices that announced tests determined to be suitable for use in the NRS, in accordance with § 462.13 (August 2020 annual notice). Also, in the August 2020 annual notice, the Secretary announced that English as a Second Language (ESL) tests and test forms approved for an extended period through February 2, 2021, are approved for an additional extended period through February 2, 2023, and that an Adult Basic Education (ABE) test and test forms previously approved for a three-year period through March 7, 2021, are approved for an extended period through March 7, 2023.

                     (87 FR 58078) an annual notice announcing that ESL tests and test forms previously approved for an extended period through February 2, 2023, were approved for an additional extended period through February 2, 2024, and that an ABE test and test forms previously approved for an extended period through March 7, 2023, were approved for an additional extended period through March 7, 2024.

                    On July 13, 2023, the Secretary published in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     (88 FR 44784) an annual notice announcing new tests that were determined to be suitable for use in the NRS, in accordance with § 462.13 (July 2023 annual notice). Three tests measured the NRS educational functioning levels for ABE at the ABE levels specified in the July 2023 annual notice, and four tests measured the new NRS educational functioning levels for ESL at the ESL levels specified in the July 2023 annual notice. With the Secretary's approval of the new ESL tests in the July 2023 annual notice, the new educational functioning levels for ESL described in Appendix A of Measures and Methods for the National Reporting System for Adult Education (OMB Control Number: 1830-0027) were implemented. In the July 2023 annual notice, the Secretary announced that ESL tests with NRS approvals expiring on February 2, 2024, may be used in the NRS during a sunset period ending on June 30, 2024.

                    On August 24, 2023, the Secretary published a notice in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     (88 FR 57949) correcting the name of one test listed in the July 2023 annual notice. All other information in the July 2023 annual notice remained the same.

                     (89 FR 19307) a notice announcing that the sunset period for ESL tests scheduled to sunset on June 30, 2024, is extended through June 30, 2025. This extension of the sunset period will allow States sufficient time for the operational activities required for the transition to the new ESL assessments identified in the July 2023 annual notice.
                </P>
                <P>The ESL educational functioning level descriptors to which the ESL tests with expiring NRS approvals are aligned and that were scheduled to be retired on June 30, 2024, are extended through June 30, 2025. Until that time, both the current ESL educational functioning level descriptors and the new ESL educational functioning level descriptors will be in effect. States must use an ESL assessment that is aligned to the appropriate ESL educational functioning level descriptors.</P>
                <P>
                    In this notice, the Secretary announces two new tests and test forms that have been determined to be suitable for use in the NRS, in accordance with § 462.13. The tests measure the NRS educational functioning levels at all ABE and ESL levels, as described in Appendix A of Measures and Methods for the National Reporting System for Adult Education (OMB Control Number 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51878"/>
                    1830-0027). These tests and their test forms are approved for a period of three years from the publication date of this notice. A three-year approval is issued with a set of conditions that must be met by the completion of the three-year time period. If these conditions are met, the test would be approved for continued use in the NRS.
                </P>
                <P>This notice also updates the delivery formats available for two tests with a three-year approval announced in the July 2023 annual notice and approved for use until July 13, 2026.</P>
                <P>Under the transition rules in § 462.4, the Secretary also announces in this notice a test with NRS approval expiring on September 7, 2024, which States and local eligible providers may continue to use during a sunset period ending on June 30, 2025.</P>
                <P>Adult education programs must use only the forms and computer-based delivery formats for the tests approved in this notice. If a particular test form or computer delivery format is not explicitly specified for a test in this notice, it is not approved to measure educational gain in the NRS.</P>

                    <E T="03">Background:</E>
                </P>
                <P>Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program in 2007 as part of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, Public Law 110-84, to encourage individuals to enter into and remain employed in public service professions. The program alleviates financial burdens associated with Federal Direct Loans for borrowers working for certain public service providers by forgiving all remaining loan balances following 10 years of public service while the borrower makes qualifying student loan payments. Since its creation in 2007, PSLF has been available to borrowers working for government at all levels, non-profit organizations that are tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and other non-profits that provide at least one of the specific services listed in the statute. This includes early care educators who work in the public sector or for non-profit organizations.</P>
                <P>
                    A significant share of early care educators, however, are not considered public sector or non-profit employees and current regulations do not provide a pathway for their eligibility for PSLF. Data from the National Survey of Early Care and Education, conducted by the Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation, estimates that extending PSLF eligibility to early childhood education (ECE) workers regardless of the tax status of their employer would allow more than 450,000 additional ECE workers to earn credit toward PSLF—about 68,000 who work in home-based settings and 390,000 who work in center-based settings—if they have student loans.

                    <FTREF/>
                     This reflects roughly one-third of the overall ECE workforce.

                         These estimates are from the Administration for Children and Families' National Survey of Early Care and Education, both the 2019 Home-Based NSECE chartbook and the 2019 Center-Based NSECE chartbook. These data show that approximately three-fourths of home-based providers had at least some college, and 72 percent of for-profit ECE workers had some college or higher.

                    On July 13, 2022, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     (87 FR 41878).
                    <SU>2</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     In the NPRM, the Department proposed improvements to PSLF that reduce regulatory and administrative barriers that have historically made it more difficult for borrowers to make progress toward forgiveness under PSLF. This included simplifying criteria to help borrowers certify employment, helping borrowers earn progress toward PSLF for months that did not count before, and providing borrowers with more opportunities to correct problems with PSLF.

                </FTNT>
                <P>Additionally, in the NPRM, the Department asked directed questions about the possibility of allowing ECE providers who are private for-profit businesses to be considered eligible employers for the purposes of PSLF. In response, the Department received many detailed comments about early childhood education as well as a range of comments in support of making other for-profit employers eligible to serve as qualifying employers for PSLF for individuals in certain occupations.</P>
                <P>
                    On November 1, 2022, the Secretary published final regulations

                         Section 103(8) of the Higher Education Act contains a definition of ”early childhood education program” that includes public preschool, Head Start, and State licensed and regulated child care programs. It does not speak to the tax-status of providers. Unlike the public Kindergarten through 12th grade system, which provides free access to education for all age-eligible children and youth, there is no parallel system for our country's youngest children. As a result, ECE is delivered through a system of mixed delivery that includes public programs, non-profit settings, and for-profit settings. 
                        <E T="03">https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ecd/policy-guidance/dear-colleague-letter-mixed-delivery.</E>
                         The vast majority of ECE settings are home-based, and do not carry non-profit tax designations. Compensation across settings is low generally, regardless of the tax-status of the ECE provider.

                     The E.O. states that investments in the care workforce are foundational to helping to retain care workers and improving health and educational outcomes for those in their care. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information about ECE providers. This RFI and the comments received in response to this RFI will not be considered as part the Affordability and Student Loans proposed rule (87 FR 41878) and any subsequent related final rules. The comments received in response to this RFI will not be used as part of the rulemaking related to the treatment of for-profit employers, including ECE providers, and eligibility for PSLF. Instead, the feedback from this RFI will help inform the Department's understanding of different approaches that might be considered when implementing non-rulemaking solutions related to this issue.

                    Given the operational and implementation hurdles associated with PSLF, the Department is interested in understanding whether there are ways that eligibility could be streamlined if all ECEs became eligible. The Department is soliciting information and data from the public on how the Department could determine employer eligibility and related considerations if for-profit ECE employers were to be considered eligible employers if they provided one of the services listed in the statute. The Department encourages 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51880"/>
                    comments from researchers, academics, policy experts, and other individuals familiar with ECE employer data; organizations that work directly with ECE workers; State and Tribal government officials who oversee and administer ECE programs; ECE practitioners; and other members of the public. The Department will review all comments received, but does not intend to respond to comments.
                </P>
                <P>The Department seeks feedback on the following questions:</P>
                <P>(1) The Department has always relied upon employer identification numbers (EINs) to identify whether an employer is a non-profit under IRC 501(c)(3). This approach has allowed the Department to create a comprehensive list of eligible employers and use a consistent identifier system. However, some for-profit businesses may be sole proprietors or other providers that do not have an EIN. Are there other uniform sources that the Department might consider using for determinations of qualifying employers?</P>
                <P>(2) If there are not other uniform sources, how should the Department address eligibility determinations of a for-profit ECE employer?</P>
                <P>(3) If in consultation with the Department, the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS), issued a voluntary Public Records Act request from the States to create a nationwide registry of EINs of ECE providers, are State and Tribal agencies that oversee and administer ECE programs in a position to collect this information? Do commenters believe that all States would provide this information? Are there any additional considerations the Department should be aware of should HHS issue this request?</P>
                <P>(4) What feedback can be provided concerning the time it would take a State or Tribe to undertake the collection of EINs for licensed and regulated providers, including the process, privacy, administrative, or other considerations that the Department should take into account?</P>
                <P>(5) Should the Department consider a process that relies on unique identifiers associated with licensure as opposed to EINs to identify eligible employers?</P>
                <P>This is a request for information only. This RFI is not a request for proposals and does not commit the Department to take any future administrative, contractual, regulatory, or other action. The Department will not pay for any information or costs that you may incur in responding to this RFI. Any documents and information submitted in response to this RFI become the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.</P>

                <P>Through the development of this Strategic Plan, DOE will:</P>
                <P>Conceptualize the unique way in which equity intersects with the energy system and to develop the concept of energy justice.</P>
                <P>• Explore objectives and initiatives towards strategic goal by examining internal and external perspectives through the lens of these widely held pillars of energy justice: Procedural Justice, Recognition Justice, Distributive Justice, and Restorative Justice</P>
                <P>• Acknowledge DOE's history, recognizing the opportunities to redress these unique historical environmental harms.</P>
                <P>• Discuss the role of equity in the context of energy systems and address the evolution of language and definitions in the space.</P>
                <P>• Clarify terminology for reference and to orient the relationship of this plan to the Equity Action Plan.</P>
                <P>• Discuss the Role of Justice 40 as a tool to implement Energy Justice and Environmental Justice at DOE.</P>
                <P>• The information provided in response to this Request for Information will inform the preparation of that plan.</P>
                <P>The Department of Energy is seeking public input to assist in carrying out certain of its responsibilities under sections 3(a)(vii) and (xi) of E.O. 14096, issued on April 21, 2023 (88 FR 25251). This RFI addresses the specific responsibilities cited as follows. Other topics in E.O. 14096 are being addressed separately by DOE and other agencies. This request for information pertains solely to collecting feedback on the proposed strategic goals. The public is encouraged to provide input in response to the questions listed to help the Department understand the potential environmental justice impact of its Strategic Plan.</P>
                <P>E.O. 14096 section 4(b) directs Federal agencies to “set forth the agency's vision, goals, priority actions, and metrics to address and advance environmental justice.” The Environmental Justice Strategic Plan “shall . . . identify and address opportunities through regulations, policies, permits, or other means to improve accountability and compliance with any statute the agency administers that affects the health and environment of communities with environmental justice concerns.” Among those actions, section 4(a) directs DOE to create an Environmental Justice Strategic Plan no later than 18 months after the date of the E.O. and every four years thereafter. The Strategic Plan shall be submitted to the Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and made available to the public online.</P>
                <P>DOE seeks to establish new goals and objectives to support resilient communities and provide meaningful public participation for all persons in DOE decision-making processes that may affect human health or the environment. DOE's environmental justice program must evolve as the environmental justice landscape evolves due to climate change, new scientific developments, and an increased policy focus on environmental justice and equity throughout the Federal Government. In brief, new and more ambitious approaches are essential, with concrete, meaningful steps needed to advance energy and environmental justice.</P>
                <P>To help guide input, DOE would appreciate feedback on the following suggested questions:</P>
                <P>1. Do the draft environmental justice strategic goals provided as follows address your interests and concerns about the advancement of environmental justice by the Department of Energy? Why or why not?</P>

                    <E T="03">Purpose:</E>
                     Form EIA-112 is an annual form that will collect 12 months of data from electric and natural gas providers about final termination notices sent to residential customers due to bill nonpayment, service disconnections of residential customers due to bill nonpayment, and service reconnections of residential customers who were disconnected due to bill nonpayment.
                </P>
                <P>No national data is currently collected on this information. Some states collect some of the data described above, but the data are inconsistent, and publication is not uniform. Form EIA-112 aims to better inform state and federal policymakers on utility disconnections by providing reliable data that can help inform appropriate levels of budgetary support for various assistance programs across the United States. The results of the survey will be published on the EIA website at the aggregated national and state level, as well as at the utility level for respondents.</P>
                <P>EIA will conduct periodic censuses of all natural gas and electric utilities above a certain size threshold. These censuses will cover respondents that complete Form EIA-176 and Form EIA-861, excluding the small electric utilities receiving Form EIA-861S. To reduce the respondent burden of this proposed data collection, while also considering data quality, for the years in between censuses, EIA will use cut-off samples from Form EIA-857 and Form EIA-861M, based on utility size and state coverage. This strategy will allow EIA to reduce respondent burden on smaller utilities, while also producing population estimates at the state level by modeling data for the utilities on the frames that were subjected to sampling but not selected.</P>

                    (8) 
                    <E T="03">Annual Estimated Reporting and Recordkeeping Cost Burden:</E>
                     EIA estimates no capital and start-up costs associated with this data collection. The information is maintained during the normal course of business. The cost of the burden hours is estimated to be $206,021.60 (2,260 burden hours times $91.16 per hour). Other than the cost of burden hours, EIA estimates no additional costs for generating, maintaining, and providing this information.
                </P>
                <P>Comments are invited on whether or not: (a) The proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of agency functions, including whether the information will have a practical utility; (b) EIA's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used, is accurate; (c) EIA can improve the quality, utility, and clarity of the information it will collect; and (d) EIA can minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, such as automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.</P>

                    <P>The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires that states periodically submit, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approve or disapprove, lists of waters (called “Section 303(d) lists”) for which existing technology- based pollution controls are not stringent enough to attain or maintain State water quality standards and for which total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) must be prepared. Waters identified on Section 303(d) lists are called “water quality-limited segments.” This notice describes the EPA's Decision Document, which identified certain additional water quality-limited segments for the Arkansas 2020 Section 303(d) list, and requests public comment on those additions.</P>

                <P>Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires that each state identify those water quality-limited segments for which existing technology-based pollution controls are not stringent enough to attain or maintain state water quality standards and for which total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) must be prepared. For each water quality-limited segment on the list, the state identifies the pollutant causing the impairment, when known. In addition, the state assigns a priority ranking for development of TMDLs based on the severity of the pollution and the uses to be made of the waters, among other factors (40 CFR 130.7(b)(4)).</P>
                <P>The EPA's Water Quality Planning and Management regulations include requirements related to the implementation of Section 303(d) of the CWA (40 CFR 130.7). The regulations require states to assemble and evaluate all existing and readily-available water quality data and to use that data to identify water quality-limited segments still requiring TMDLs every two years. Where a state does not use certain data, it must provide a rationale. The list of waters still needing TMDL development must also include priority rankings and must identify the waters targeted for TMDL development during the next two years (40 CFR 130.7).</P>
                <P>
                    The EPA received Arkansas's submittal of its listing decisions under Section 303(d)(2) on June 2, 2022. On September 28, 2023, the EPA partially approved and partially disapproved Arkansas's 2020 Section 303(d) list of water quality-limited segments based upon the Agency's finding that Arkansas did not use certain water quality information and therefore did not identify certain water quality-limited segments based upon existing data and public input. The EPA analyzed the information and identified seven additional water quality-limited segments for inclusion on Arkansas's 2020 Section 303(d) list.
                    <PRTPAGE P="51884"/>
                </P>
                <P>The EPA is providing the public an opportunity to review and comment on its identification of these water quality- limited segments for Arkansas's 2020 Section 303(d) list as required by 40 CFR 130.7(d)(2). The EPA will consider public comments and make any appropriate revisions before transmitting the list of water quality-limited segments to the State.</P>

                     The FTC collects information to carry out its administrative responsibilities pursuant to its Rules of Practice. Any person, partnership, or corporation may request advice from the Commission or FTC staff regarding a course of action the requester contemplates. The Commission's rules require requesters to provide the information necessary to facilitate resolution of the requests, including information on the question to be resolved, the identity of the companies or persons involved, and other material facts. See FTC Rule 1.2, 16 CFR 1.2. In addition, the FTC's ethics regulations require former employees who are seeking ethical clearance to participate in FTC matters to submit screening affidavits to facilitate resolution of their requests. See FTC Rule 4.1(b), 16 CFR 4.1(b). These requirements prevent the improper use of confidential nonpublic information acquired while working at the FTC. The Commission's Rules of Practice also authorize outside parties to request employee testimony, through compulsory process or otherwise, and to request documentary material through compulsory process in cases or matters to which the agency is not a party. See FTC Rule 4.11(e), 16 CFR 4.11(e). These rules require persons seeking testimony or material from the Commission to submit a statement in support of the request setting forth the party's interest in the case or matter, the relevance of the desired testimony or material, and a discussion of whether it is reasonably available from other sources.
                </P>
                <P>
                    The FTC also allows consumers to report fraud, identity theft, National Do Not Call Registry violations, and other violations of law through telephone hotlines and three online consumer report forms. Consumers may call a hotline phone number or log on to the FTC's website to report violations using the applicable reporting forms. The provision of this information is voluntary. The FTC also conducts customer satisfaction surveys regarding the support that the Commission's Consumer Response Center provides to consumers to obtain information about the overall effectiveness of the call center and online complaint intake forms. This information assists Bureau of Consumer Protection staff in carrying out the agency's consumer protection mission. The FTC is also mandated by Congress under the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, 18 U.S.C. 1001 
                    <E T="03">et seq.,</E>

                    <E T="03">Description:</E>
                     ACF intends to request approval from OMB for an extension with revisions for a generic clearance to pre-test data collections with more than nine participants to identify and resolve any questions or problems that may arise, and to assess potential data quality, prior to full-scale administration.
                </P>
                <P>This generic is available for use by ACF program offices but is most often used by the ACF Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE). OPRE studies ACF programs and the populations they serve, through rigorous research and evaluation projects. These include evaluations of existing programs, evaluations of innovative approaches to helping low-income children and families, research syntheses, and descriptive and exploratory studies.</P>
                <P>ACF program offices could benefit from use of this pretesting generic for similar purposes outlined above, as well as to inform the development of data collection activities such as grant recipient forms, forms used by programs on ACF's behalf, and other data collection efforts driven by ACF. This could be used to inform a variety of data collection efforts in ACF to allow for consistent data requests across program offices that are high quality and appropriate to respondents who represent ACF program populations. For example, ACF envisions using this mechanism to pre-test sexual orientation and gender identity questions with youth. This is an area with minimal research and would benefit ACF program offices that serve youth. Program offices are also considering use of this generic for efforts to support language access for data collections, which a priority as detailed in Executive Order 13166, “Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency.”</P>
                <P>To improve the development of its data collection activities, ACF will use the pre-testing generic clearance to employ a variety of techniques including cognitive and usability laboratory and field techniques, behavior coding, exploratory interviews, respondent debriefing questionnaires, split sample experiments, focus groups, and pilot studies/pre-tests. These activities allow ACF to identify if and when a data collection may be simplified for respondents, respondent burden may be reduced, data elements could be improved, and other possible improvements.</P>
                <P>Following standard OMB requirements, ACF will submit directly to OMB, a request specific to each individual proposed data collection activity under this generic clearance. Each request will include the individual instrument(s), a justification specific to the individual information collection, and any supplementary documents. ACF requests OMB review within 10 days of receiving an individual request.</P>
                <P>Results of these methodological studies may be made public through methodological appendices or footnotes, reports on instrument development, instrument user guides, descriptions of respondent behavior, and other publications or presentations describing findings of methodological interest. The results of these pre-testing activities may be prepared for presentation at professional meetings or publication in professional journals. When necessary, results will be labeled as exploratory in nature and any limitations will be described.</P>

                <P>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Office of the Chief Learning Officer (OCLO) National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) Training Catalog Batch Data seeks to collect information from organizations and academic institutions regarding their course specific technical information to NICCS regarding how their training courses map to the National Initiative for Cybersecurity (NICE) Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) Specialty Areas.</P>
                <P>
                    The NICCS website is a national online resource for cybersecurity awareness, education, talent management, and professional 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51893"/>
                    development and training. Its mission is to provide comprehensive cybersecurity resources to the public.
                </P>
                <P>To promote cybersecurity education, and to provide a comprehensive resource for the Nation, NICCS developed the Cybersecurity Training and Education Catalog. The NICCS Education and Training Catalog is a central location to help cybersecurity professionals of all skill levels find cybersecurity-related courses online and in person across the nation. All of the courses are aligned to the specialty areas of The Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework). Organizations and or academic institution interested in listing courses with NICCS are requested to complete a vendor vetting process in order to be considered for inclusion in the NICCS education and Training Catalog. Once approved, organizations and academic institutions are asked to provide technical information (“training catalog batch data”) to NICCS regarding how their training courses map to the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) Specialty Areas. Course mapping to these Specialty Areas allows users to tailor their individual coursework and is dependent upon the training catalog batch data to do so. The training catalog batch data is technical in nature, is not privacy sensitive, and does not include personally identifiable information. The training catalog batch data is submitted to the CISA NICCS Supervisory Office (SO) for review. Then upon further review and approval, the organization/academic institution's course is listed in the NICCS Education and Training Catalog.</P>
                <P>The cyber-specific authorities to receive such information support the Department's general authority to receive information from any federal or non-federal entity in support of the mission responsibilities of the Department. Section 201 of the Homeland Security Act authorizes the Secretary “[t]o access, receive, and analyze law enforcement information, intelligence information, and other information from agencies of the Federal Government, State and local government agencies (including law enforcement agencies), and private sector entities, and to integrate such information, in support of the mission responsibilities of the Department.” 6 U.S.C. 121(d)(1); see also 6 U.S.C. 121(d)(12). The following authorities also permit DHS to collect this information: Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. 3546; Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-21, Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection (2003); and National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-54/HSPD-23, Cybersecurity Policy (2009).</P>

                    <E T="03">Note:</E>
                     Any information received from the public in support of the NICCS Cybersecurity Training and Education Catalog is completely voluntary. Organizations and individuals who do not provide information can still utilize the NICCS website and Catalog without restriction or penalty. An organization or individual who wants their information removed from the NICCS website and/or Cybersecurity Training and Education Catalog can email the NICCS Supervisory Office. There are no requirements for a provider to fill out a specific form for their information to be removed; standard email requests will be honored.
                </P>
                <P>The Office of Management and Budget is particularly interested in comments which:</P>

                    CISA OCLO seeks to utilize four separate forms in order to collect the requested information from organizations and academic institutions. CISA OCLO will use the NICCS Cybersecurity Training Course Form and the NICCS Cybersecurity Certification Form to collect information via a publicly accessible website called the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) website (
                    <E T="03">https://niccs.cisa.gov</E>
                    ). Collected information from these two forms will be included in the Cybersecurity Training and Education Catalog that is hosted on the NICCS website. Requested information categories in these forms include the training providers name, course title, course description, course length, course modality, among other course information useful for users.
                </P>
                <P>The NICCS Supervisory Office will use information collected from the NICCS Vendor Vetting Form to primarily manage communications with the training/workforce development providers; this collected information will not be shared with the public and is intended for internal use only. Additionally, this information will be used to validate training providers before uploading their training and certification information to the Training Catalog. Requested information in the NICCS Vendor Vetting form include vendor name, address, points of contact and a few multiple-choice questions to ensure they are a legitimate business.</P>
                <P>The NICCS Supervisory Office will use information collected from the NICCS Mapping Tool Form to provide an end user with information of how their position or job title aligns to the new Cybersecurity Framework 1.1. This collection of inputs and output (in the form of a report) will be savable by the end user on their computer to be uploaded at a later time for further use if required. This collected information will not be shared with the public and is intended for internal use only. Requested information in the NICCS Mapping form include: Selecting various work roles (based on the NICE Framework), selecting tasks required for that work role, and including job description details.</P>
                <P>The information will be collected via fully electronic web forms or partially electronic via email. Collection will be coordinated between the public and NICCS via email.</P>
                <P>The following forms are fully electronic:</P>

                     TSA's aircraft operator security standards regulations, codified at 49 CFR part 1544, require aircraft operators to adopt, maintain, update, and comply with TSA-approved comprehensive security programs to ensure the safety of persons and property traveling on their flights against acts of criminal violence and air piracy, and the introduction of explosives, incendiaries, or weapons aboard an aircraft. In addition, part 1544 requires the affected aircraft operators to submit information on aircraft operators' flight crews and other employees, passengers, and cargo. The information collection includes information regarding security program, amendments, fingerprint based criminal history records check (CHRC) applications; recordkeeping requirements for security program, CHRCs, and training. These programs and related records are subject to TSA inspection.

                     This submission covers documents that will permit the continued processing of all Sections 202 and 811 capital advance projects that have not yet reached final closing. For example this submission includes documents for processing of the application for firm commitment to final closing of the capital advance. These documents are needed to assist HUD in determining the Owner's eligibility and capacity to finalize the development of a housing project under the Section 202 and Section 811 Capital Advance Programs. The Office of the Inspector General had also requested additional required certification language. HUD is also adding a new standard form HUD-90173-D to facilitate the renewal of project rental assistance contracts (PRACs). The form HUD-90173-D will reflect long-standing contract amendment language with updates to accommodate availability of both 5-year and annual terms for Section 202 PRACs. The number of annual contract renewal amendments is expected to decrease for each of the next three years as additional properties switch from annual to five-year contracts. The Department also notes that PRAC contract renewal amendments may be executed utilizing DocuSign to obtain owner and HUD staff signatures. Finally, HUD has revised the form HUD-2554 to update contract provisions for Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements consistent with changes the Department of Labor (DOL) recently made to regulations at 29 CFR 5.5.

                    <P>Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on May 7, 2024, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of TP-Link USA Corporation of Irvine, California and TP-Link Corporation PTE Ltd. of Singapore. A supplement was filed on May 15, 2024. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain wi-fi access points, routers, range extenders, controllers and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,636,550 (“the '550 patent”); U.S. Patent No. 8,176,148 (“the '148 patent”); U.S. Patent No. 8,229,357 (“the '357 patent”); U.S. Patent No. 7,672,268 (“the '268 patent”); and U.S. Patent No. 8,774,008 (“the '008 patent”). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists or is in the process of being established in the United States as required by the applicable Federal Statute. On June 10, 2024, counsel for respondent Netgear Inc. filed a Supplemental Submission on the Public Interest and Request for Leave to File Out of Time. On June 12, 2024, an Opposition to Netgear's Motion to Submit a Supplemental Submission on the Public Interest was filed on behalf of complainants. The Commission has determined to accept both filings. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Notice of Lodging of Proposed Consent Decree Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Washington Model Toxics Control Act and Notice of Availability of Draft Restoration Plan/Environmental Assessment of Restoration Project Incorporated Into Proposed Consent Decree</SUBJECT>
                <P>
                    On June 13, 2024, the Department of Justice lodged a proposed consent decree with the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in the lawsuit entitled 
                    <E T="03">United States of America, State of Washington, Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe, Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe, Skokomish Indian Tribe, and Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation</E>
                     v. 
                    <E T="03">Pope Resources, OPG Properties LLC, and OPG Port Gamble LLC,</E>
                     Civil Action No. 3:24-cv-05470, Docket No. 2-1.
                </P>
                <P>The complaint asserts claims against Pope Resources, a Delaware Limited Partnership; OPG Properties LLC; and OPG Port Gamble LLC (Defendants) for natural resource damages by the United States on behalf of the Department of the Interior, the State of Washington through the Washington Department of Ecology, the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe, the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe, the Skokomish Indian Tribe, and the Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation (collectively, the Trustees), pursuant to section 107(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9607(a); section 311 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. 1321; and the Washington Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA), RCW 70A.305.</P>
                <P>The proposed consent decree resolves claims alleged against Defendants for natural resource damages caused by releases of hazardous substances from the former Pope &amp; Talbot sawmill facility, currently owned by OPG Port Gamble LLC and previously owned and operated by Pope Resources and OPG Properties LLC, to Port Gamble Bay in Kitsap County, Washington. The settlement requires Defendants to construct, implement, maintain, and monitor a habitat restoration project in Port Gamble Bay that involves restoring approximately 20 acres of shoreline and intertidal habitat, placing sand cover, and planting eelgrass. The settlement also requires Defendants to fund future long-term maintenance, monitoring, and stewardship of the project, and pay the Trustees' past and estimated future costs for NRD assessment and restoration implementation and oversight. The Defendants will receive covenants not to sue under the statutes listed in the proposed consent decree for specified natural resource damages.</P>
                <P>The Trustees have developed a Draft Restoration Plan and Environmental Assessment (“RP/EA”) for the habitat restoration project, incorporated into the proposed consent decree. The Draft RP/EA proposes to select the habitat restoration project to address injuries to natural resources in the Port Gamble Bay.</P>
                <P>
                    The publication of this notice opens a period for public comment on the proposed consent decree and the Draft RP/EA. Comments on the proposed consent decree should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General, Environmental and Natural Resources Division, and should refer to

                <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
                <P>DOL, as part of continuing efforts to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information before submitting them to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for final approval. This program helps to ensure requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements can be properly assessed.</P>
                <P>As a part of this revision request, ETA has made changes to the Participant Individual Record Layout (ETA-9172), (Program) Performance Report (ETA-9173) that include: (1) adding new program-specific versions of the ETA-9173 Quarterly Performance Reports (QPRs)—INAP Youth, and NFJP Housing, and 508 compliant versions for each template. (2) adding data elements needed by program offices, (new elements, and checks/unchecks); and (3) revising element names, definitions/instructions, and code fields to enhance the clarity of the collection. DOL is also proposing updates in this collection to adhere to the new requirements in OMB's Statistical Policy Directive No. 15 on Race and Ethnicity. Until the Department of Education is able to update its corresponding ICRs, the Joint ICR (OMB Control No. 1205-0526) will continue to use the same categories for Race and Ethnicity as previously approved. During the transition period, DOL will combine the Race categories for “White” and “Middle Eastern or North African” into a single “White” category in the joint ICR for the WIOA Statewide Performance Report (ETA-9169). Similarly, DOL will continue to calculate “More than one Race” according to the Joint ICR for the WIOA Statewide Performance Report (ETA-9169), while using “Multiracial and/or Multiethnic” in the DOL-only Quarterly Performance Reports (ETA-9173).</P>
                <P>These revisions do not add burden to the collection. The added templates accommodate data collection that has previously been collected using different approved templates associated with this collection.</P>
                <P>Section 116 of WIOA (29 U.S.C. 3141) authorizes this information collection. The Department of Labor's (DOL)'s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) developed the (Program) Performance Report (ETA-9173) and the Pay-for-Performance Report (ETA-9174) to facilitate State performance reporting. In order to collect the participant level data that will be aggregated and displayed in the (Program) Performance Report (ETA-9173) quarterly and the Pay-for-Performance Report (ETA-9174) annual reports, States will use a standardized individual record file for program participants, called the DOL Participant Individual Record Layout (PIRL, ETA-9172). The PIRL provides a standardized set of data elements, definitions, and reporting instructions that will be used to describe the characteristics, activities, and outcomes of WIOA and DOL partner program participants. States and grantees will be required to collect participant information that corresponds with the data elements and descriptions delineated within the PIRL. Once collected, this information will then be aggregated according to the conditions outlined in the specifications found within the Program Performance Report spreadsheet. This document details the common data elements and technical specifications necessary for calculation of reporting elements under all the DOL programs listed in the paragraph below. Once aggregated, the outcomes of the PIRL data will be submitted by the States and grantees to ETA and then displayed according to the framework within the (Program) Performance Report. Each program mentioned in this supporting statement will generate a program specific report that mirrors the construct of the (Program) Performance Report. DOL requires States and grantees to certify and submit the (Program) Performance Report to ETA on a quarterly basis.</P>
                <P>This ICR is the product of a joint effort among the DOL offices that administer the following programs: WIOA Adult, WIOA Dislocated Worker, WIOA Youth, National Dislocated Worker Grants, Dislocated Worker Projects authorized under WIOA sec. 169(c), Wagner-Peyser Employment Service, National Farmworker Jobs Program, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Indian and Native American Program, as well as non-WIOA covered programs, including Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), REO, H-1B discretionary grants, Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), Apprenticeship grants, and the Jobs for Veterans' State Grants Programs. While H-1B grants, TAA, SCSEP, Apprenticeship grants and the REO programs are not authorized under WIOA, these programs utilize the data element definitions and reporting templates in this ICR.</P>
                <P>The accuracy, reliability, and comparability of program reports submitted by States and grantees using Federal funds are fundamental elements of good public administration and are necessary tools for maintaining and demonstrating system integrity. The use of a standard set of data elements, definitions, and specifications at all levels of the workforce system helps states to coordinate funding and leverage resources available to create a more efficient and effective system to improve the quality of the performance information that is received by DOL.</P>
                <P>
                    The set of primary indicators of performance represents the key results that ETA strives to achieve for their customers, and that ETA and Congress are interested in measuring. Using this set of primary indicators affords ETA the ability to describe, in a similar manner, the core purposes of the workforce system—through the program services received, how many people found jobs; what were their earnings; and what skill gains they achieved. They are an integral part of ETA's performance accountability system, and through the Workforce Performance Accountability, Information, and Reporting System, ETA will continue to collect from States and grantees the data on program activities, participants, and outcomes that are necessary for program management and to convey full and 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51905"/>
                    accurate information on the performance of workforce programs to policymakers and stakeholders.

                <P>The Office of Worker's Compensation Programs (OWCP) administers the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), which provides for medical and compensation benefits for work related injuries or disease from federal employment. 5 U.S.C. 8149, Congress gives the Secretary of Labor authority to prescribe the rules and regulations necessary for the administration and enforcement of the FECA.</P>
                <P>The relevant statutory provision 5 U.S.C. 8103, Medical services and initial medical and other benefits, which reads as follows:</P>
                <P>
                    (a) The United States shall furnish to an employee who is injured while in the performance of duty, the services, appliances, and supplies prescribed or recommended by a qualified physician, which the Secretary of Labor considers 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51906"/>
                    likely to cure, give relief, reduce the degree or the period of disability, or aid in lessening the amount of the monthly compensation. These services, appliances, and supplies shall be furnished—
                </P>
                <P>(1) whether or not disability has arisen;</P>
                <P>(2) notwithstanding that the employee has accepted or is entitled to receive benefits under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title or another retirement system for employees of the Government; and</P>
                <P>(3) by or on the order of United States medical officers and hospitals, or, at the employee's option, by or on the order of physicians and hospitals designated or approved by the Secretary. The employee may initially select a physician to provide medical services, appliances, and supplies, in accordance with such regulations and instructions as the Secretary considers necessary, and may be furnished necessary and reasonable transportation and expenses incident to the securing of such services, appliances, and supplies. These expenses, when authorized or approved by the Secretary, shall be paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary, under such limitations or conditions as he considers necessary, may authorize the employing agencies to provide for the initial furnishing of medical and other benefits under this section. The Secretary may certify vouchers for these expenses out of the Employees' Compensation Fund when the immediate superior of the employee certifies that the expense was incurred in respect to an injury which was accepted by the employing agency as probably compensable under this subchapter. The Secretary shall prescribe the form and content of the certificate.</P>
                <P>In accordance with 20 CFR 10.330, OWCP requires each employee who is receiving benefits to provide a medical report from their attending physician. Per 20 CFR 10.332, OWCP will request the attending physician to provide a report at periodic intervals in all cases requiring hospital treatment or prolonged care. The attending physician will be asked to describe the continuing need for medical treatment for the accepted condition, prognosis, description of work tolerance limitations, and the physician's opinion on causal relationship between the diagnosed condition and the employee's work factors.</P>
                <P>Further, 20 CFR 10.501 states:</P>
                <P>(a) The employee is responsible for providing sufficient medical evidence to justify payment of any compensation sought.</P>
                <P>(1) To support payment of continuing compensation where an employee has been found entitled to periodic benefits, narrative medical evidence must be submitted whenever OWCP requests it but ordinarily not less than once a year and with any filing of a form CA-1032. It must contain a physician's rationalized opinion as to whether the specific period of alleged disability is causally related to the employee's accepted injury or illness.</P>
                <P>(2) For those employees with more serious conditions not likely to improve and for employees over the age of 65, OWCP may require less frequent documentation, but ordinarily not less than once every three years.</P>

                <P>The Office of Worker's Compensation Programs (OWCP) administers the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), which provides for continuation of pay or compensation for work related injuries or disease from federal employment. 5 U.S.C. 8149, Congress gives the Secretary of Labor authority to prescribe the rules and regulations necessary for the administration and enforcement of the FECA.</P>
                <P>The relevant statutory provision allowing for an individual to make a claim for compensation benefits is found at 5 U.S.C. 8102, Compensation for disability or death of employee, and reads as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) The United States shall pay compensation as specified by this subchapter for the disability or death of an employee resulting from personal injury sustained while in the performance of his duty, unless the injury or death is—</P>
                <P>(1) caused by willful misconduct of the employee;</P>
                <P>(2) caused by the employee's intention to bring about the injury or death of himself or of another; or</P>
                <P>(3) proximately caused by the intoxication of the injured employee.</P>
                <P>(b) Disability or death from a war-risk hazard or during or as a result of capture, detention, or other restraint by a hostile force or individual, suffered by an employee who is employed outside the continental United States or in Alaska or in the areas and installations in the Republic of Panama made available to the United States pursuant to the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements (as described in section 3(a) of the Panama Canal Act of 1979), is deemed to have resulted from personal injury sustained while in the performance of his duty, whether or not the employee was engaged in the course of employment when the disability or disability resulting in death occurred or when he was taken by the hostile force or individual. This subsection does not apply to an individual—</P>
                <P>(1) whose residence is at or in the vicinity of the place of his employment and who was not living there solely because of the exigencies of his employment, unless he was injured or taken while engaged in the course of his employment; or</P>
                <P>(2) who is a prisoner of war or a protected individual under the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and is detained or utilized by the United States.</P>
                <P>The relevant statutory provision 5 U.S.C. 8103, Medical services and initial medical and other benefits, which reads as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) The United States shall furnish to an employee who is injured while in the performance of duty, the services, appliances, and supplies prescribed or recommended by a qualified physician, which the Secretary of Labor considers likely to cure, give relief, reduce the degree or the period of disability, or aid in lessening the amount of the monthly compensation. These services, appliances, and supplies shall be furnished—</P>
                <P>(1) whether or not disability has arisen;</P>
                <P>(2) notwithstanding that the employee has accepted or is entitled to receive benefits under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title or another retirement system for employees of the Government; and</P>
                <P>(3) by or on the order of United States medical officers and hospitals, or, at the employee's option, by or on the order of physicians and hospitals designated or approved by the Secretary. The employee may initially select a physician to provide medical services, appliances, and supplies, in accordance with such regulations and instructions as the Secretary considers necessary, and may be furnished necessary and reasonable transportation and expenses incident to the securing of such services, appliances, and supplies. These expenses, when authorized or approved by the Secretary, shall be paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary, under such limitations or conditions as he considers necessary, may authorize the employing agencies to provide for the initial furnishing of medical and other benefits under this section. The Secretary may certify vouchers for these expenses out of the Employees' Compensation Fund when the immediate superior of the employee certifies that the expense was incurred in respect to an injury which was accepted by the employing agency as probably compensable under this subchapter. The Secretary shall prescribe the form and content of the certificate.</P>

                    <P>The Department of Labor, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance request for comment to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This request helps to ensure that: requested data can be provided in the desired format; reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; collection instruments are clearly understood; and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Division of Federal Employees' Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation, (OWCP/DFELHWC) is soliciting comments on the information collection for Peace Corps Volunteer Authorization for Examination and/or Treatment, CA-15.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
                <P>
                    The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) administers the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. 8101 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                     The statute provides for the payment of benefits for wage loss and/or for permanent impairment to a scheduled member, arising out of a work-related injury or disease. The Act outlines the elements of pay which are to be included in an individual's pay rate, and sets forth various other criteria for determining eligibility to and the amount of benefits, including: augmentation of basic compensation for individuals with qualifying dependents; a requirement to report any earnings during a period that compensation is claimed; a prohibition against concurrent receipt of FECA benefits and benefits from the Office of Personnel Management or certain Department of Veterans Affairs benefits; a mandate that money collected from a liable third party found responsible for 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51909"/>
                    the injury for which compensation has been paid is applied to benefits paid or payable.
                </P>
                <P>A Peace Corps Volunteer who sustains an injury or contracts an illness overseas while in Peace Corps service may be entitled to benefits under the FECA. Peace Corps Volunteers are in the performance of duty while abroad during the period of Peace Corps service for purposes of FECA coverage. An injury sustained outside the United States during service is deemed proximately caused by such service, unless the injury or illness was proximately caused by willful misconduct, intention to bring about injury or death, or intoxication.</P>
                <P>The Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018 (Farr-Castle), regulates various aspects of the Peace Corps, including changes to the provision of health care to volunteers. The legislation is named in honor of former Peace Corps volunteers Sam Farr, a retired Democratic congressman, and Nick Castle, who lost his life at age 23 while serving overseas in the Peace Corps in 2013.</P>
                <P>The Peace Corps was established on September 22, 1961, by Public Law 87-293, known as the “Peace Corps Act.” It authorizes the enrollment of qualified citizens and nationals of the United States as “volunteers” and “volunteer leaders” for service abroad in interested countries and areas, to help the people of such countries and areas in meeting their needs for trained workers, and to help promote a better understanding of the American people on the part of the peoples served and a better understanding of other peoples on the part of the American people.</P>
                <P>Under the provisions of the FECA, 5 U.S.C. 8142 of the FECA provides that,</P>
                <P>(a) For the purpose of this section, “volunteer” means—</P>
                <P>(1) a volunteer enrolled in the Peace Corps under section 2504 of title 22;</P>
                <P>(2) a volunteer leader enrolled in the Peace Corps under section 2505 of title 22; and</P>
                <P>(3) an applicant for enrollment as a volunteer or volunteer leader during a period of training under section 2507(a) of title 22 before enrollment.</P>
                <P>Entitlement to disability compensation payments does not commence until the day after the date of termination of service as a volunteer. 5 U.S.C. 8142(b).</P>
                <P>Farr-Castle directs the Secretary of the Department of Labor to authorize the Director of the Peace Corps to furnish medical benefits to a volunteer, who is injured during the volunteer's period of service, for a period of 120 days following the termination of such service if the Director certifies that the volunteer's injury probably meets the requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. 8142(c)(3). The Secretary may then certify vouchers for these expenses for such volunteers out of the Employees' Compensation Fund.</P>
                <P>OWCP and the Peace Corps collaborated on this form which authorizes medical treatment for recently terminated Peace Corps volunteers who require medical treatment for injuries/exposure sustained in the performance of their volunteer service. Issuance of this form will solely be at the discretion of the Peace Corps. This bridges the gap between the occurrence of an initial injury and/or disease exposure and the actual adjudication of a claim by OWCP by helping ensure that recently terminated volunteers receive prompt medical care, without delay, for a period of 120 days following separation from service.</P>

                     Dodd Frank Act amended section 308 of the FIRREA to require NCUA, Office of the Comptroller of Currency, and the Federal Reserve Board to establish a program to comply with its goals to preserve and encourage Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs). The NCUA Board issued Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement (IRPS) 13-1 establishing a MDI preservation program to comply with FIRREA section 308 goals. The IRPS identifies the procedure for a federally insured credit union to determine and document its ability to designate itself as a MDI, resulting in the ability to participate in the Program.

                     The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1757(7), 1757(8), 1757(15), lists securities, deposits, and other obligations in which a Federal Credit Union (FCU) may invest. The regulations related to these areas are contained in part 703 and section 721.3 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations which set forth requirements related to maintaining an adequate investment program. The information collected is used by the NCUA to determine compliance with the appropriate sections of the NCUA Rules and Regulations and Federal Credit Union Act, which governs investment and deposit activities on the basis of safety and soundness concerns. It is used to determine the level of risk that exists within a credit union, the actions taken by the credit union to mitigate such risk, and helps prevent losses to federal credit unions and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).

                     The purpose of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51913"/>
                    Program is to help ensure the vitality and diversity of the scientific and engineering workforce of the United States. The program recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students who are pursuing research-based master's and doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and in STEM education. The GRFP provides three years of support, to be used during a five-year fellowship period, for the graduate education of individuals who have demonstrated their potential for significant research achievements in STEM and STEM education.
                </P>
                <P>The Graduate Research Fellowship Program uses several sources of information in assessing and documenting program performance and impact. These sources include reports from program evaluation, the GRFP Committee of Visitors, and data compiled from the applications. In addition, GRFP Fellows submit annual activity reports to NSF.</P>
                <P>
                    The GRFP Completion report is proposed as a continuing component of the annual reporting requirement for the program. This report, submitted by the GRFP Institution, certifies the completion status of Fellows at the institution (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     in progress, completed, graduated, transferred, or withdrawn). The existing Completion Report, Grants Roster Report, and the Program Expense Report comprise the GRFP Annual Reporting requirements from the Grantee GRFP institution. Through submission of the Completion Report to NSF GRFP institutions certify the current status of all GRFP Fellows at the institution as either: In Progress, Graduated, Transferred, or Withdrawn. For Graduate Fellows with Graduated status, the graduation date is a required reporting element. Collection of this information allows the program to obtain information on the current status of Fellows, the number and/or percentage of Graduate Fellowship recipients who complete a science or engineering graduate degree, and an estimate of time to degree completion. The report must be certified and submitted by the institution's designated Coordinating Official (CO) annually.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Use of the Information:</E>
                     The completion report data provides NSF with accurate Fellow information regarding completion of the Fellows' graduate programs. The data is used by NSF in its assessment of the impact of its investments in the GRFP, and informs its program management.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Estimate of Burden:</E>
                     Overall average time will be 15 minutes per Fellow (8,250 Fellows) for a total of 2,063 hours for all institutions with Fellows. An estimate for institutions with 12 or fewer Fellows will be 1 hour, institutions with 12-48 fellows will be 4 hours, and institutions over 48 Fellows will be 10 hours.

                     The information in this form will be used by the Peace Corps Office of Medical Services to determine whether an Applicant will, with reasonable accommodation, be able to perform the essential functions of a Peace Corps Volunteer assignment and complete a tour of service without unreasonable disruption due to health problems and, if so, to establish the level of medical and other support, if any, that may be required to reasonably accommodate the Applicant. The information in this form is also used as a baseline assessment for the Peace Corps Medical Officers overseas who are responsible for the Volunteer's medical care. Finally, the Peace Corps may use the information in this form as a point of reference in the event that, after completion of the Applicant's service as a Volunteer, he or she makes a worker's compensation claim under the Federal Employee Compensation Act (FECA).

                     Durable Medical Equipment (DME) is any equipment that provides therapeutic benefits to a patient in need because of certain medical conditions and/or illness. They consist of items that are primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose; are not useful to a person in the absence of illness or injury; are ordered or prescribed by a physician; are reusable; can stand repeated use, and are appropriate for use in the home. Other devices covered in this guidance include prosthetic equipment (cardiac pacemakers), hearing aids, orthotic items (artificial devices such as braces and splints), and prostheses (artificial body parts). The information collected will assist in the determination of Peace Corps eligibility. If eligible, it will assist with ongoing care during service. All applicants to the Peace Corps must have a medical clearance that will determine their ability to serve in a particular country.

                    The Exchange proposes to provide a temporary pricing incentive program in which Members or Non-Members that purchase historical Short Volume Reports will receive a percentage fee discount where specific purchase thresholds are met. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to provide a 20% discount for ad-hoc purchases of historical Short Volume Reports of $20,000 or more.

                     The proposed program will apply to all market participants irrespective of whether the market participant is a new or current purchaser; however, the discount cannot be combined with any other discounts offered by the Exchange. The Exchange intends to introduce the discount program beginning June 4, 2024, with the program remaining in effect through June 30, 2024. The Exchange also notes that it previously adopted the same discount program last year and proposes to update the Fees Schedule with the new program dates accordingly.

                    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data. The Exchange believes that the proposed fee changes will further broaden the availability of U.S. equity market data to investors consistent with the principles of Regulation NMS. The Exchange believes the dissemination of historical short volume data via historical Short Volume Reports benefits investors through increased transparency and may promote better informed trading, as well as research and studies of the equities industry. Nevertheless, the Exchange notes that such data is not necessary for trading and as noted above, is entirely optional. Moreover, several other exchanges offer a similar data product which offer the same type of data content through similar reports.

                    The Exchange operates in a highly competitive environment. Indeed, there are currently 16 registered equities exchanges that trade equities. Based on publicly available information, no single equities exchange has more than 16% of the equity market share.

                     The Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining prices, products, and services in the securities markets. Particularly, in Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the market system “has been remarkably successful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that are most important to investors and listed companies.”

                     Making similar data products available to market participants fosters competition in the marketplace, and constrains the ability of exchanges to charge supercompetitive fees. In the event that a market participant views one exchange's data product as more attractive than the competition, that market participant can, and often does, switch between similar products. The proposed fees are a result of the competitive environment of the U.S. equities industry as the Exchange seeks to adopt fees to attract purchasers of historical Short Volume Reports.

                    The Exchange believes that the proposed incentive program for any Member or non-Member who purchases historical Short Volume Reports is reasonable because such purchasers would receive a 20% discount for purchasing $20,000 or more worth of historical Short Volume Reports. The Exchange believes the proposed discount is reasonable as it will give purchasers the ability to use and test the historical Short Volume Reports at a discounted rate, prior to purchasing additional months or a monthly subscription, and will therefore encourage users to purchase historical Short Volume Reports. Further, the proposed discount is intended to promote increased use of the Exchange's historical Short Volume Reports by defraying some of the costs a purchaser would ordinarily have to expend before using the data product. The Exchange believes that the proposed discount is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because it will apply equally to all Members and non-Members who purchase historical Short Volume Reports. Lastly, the purchase of this data product is discretionary and not compulsory. Indeed, no market participant is required to purchase the historical Short Volume Reports, and the Exchange is not required to make historical Short Volume Reports available to all investors. Potential purchasers may request the data at any 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51918"/>
                    time if they believe it to be valuable or may decline to purchase such data. As noted above, the Exchange previously adopted a similar discount program last year.

                <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange operates in a highly competitive environment in which the Exchange must continually adjust its fees to remain competitive. Because competitors are free to modify their own fees in response, the Exchange believes that the degree to which fee changes in this market may impose any burden on competition is extremely limited. As discussed above, the Exchange's historical Short Volume Reports offering is subject to direct competition from several other options exchanges that offer similar data products. Moreover, purchase of historical Short Volume Reports is optional. It is designed to help investors understand underlying market trends to improve the quality of investment decisions, but is not necessary to execute a trade.</P>
                <P>The proposed rule changes are grounded in the Exchange's efforts to compete more effectively. In this competitive environment, potential purchasers are free to choose which, if any, similar product to purchase to satisfy their need for market information. As a result, the Exchange believes this proposed rule change permits fair competition among national securities exchanges. Further, the Exchange believes that these changes will not cause any unnecessary or inappropriate burden on intermarket competition, as the proposed incentive program applies uniformly to any purchaser of historical Short Volume Reports.</P>

                <P>
                    As described more fully below, the Exchange proposes to amend NYSE Rule 7.35 (General) and NYSE Rule 7.35B (DMM-Facilitated Closing 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51919"/>
                    Auctions) to: (i) align the definition of Imbalance Reference Price for a Closing Imbalance; (ii) replace the Regulatory Closing Imbalance with an enhanced Significant Closing Imbalance; and (iii) include Closing D Orders in the Total Imbalance calculation ten minutes before the scheduled end of Core Trading Hours.
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Background</HD>
                <P>According to the Exchange, Imbalance information on the Exchange means better-priced orders on one side of the market compared to both better-priced and at-price orders on the other side of the market. The Exchange disseminates two types of Imbalance publications: Total Imbalance and Closing Imbalance. Total Imbalance information is disseminated for all Auctions, and Closing Imbalance information is disseminated for the Closing Auction only.</P>
                <P>
                    The Exchange states that, beginning ten minutes before the scheduled end of Core Trading Hours, the Exchange begins disseminating through its proprietary data feed Closing Auction Imbalance Information that is calculated based on the interest eligible to participate in the Closing Auction.

                     The Closing Auction Imbalance Information includes the Continuous Book Clearing Price, which is the price at which all better-priced orders eligible to trade in the Closing Auction on the Side of the Imbalance can be traded.

                <P>The Exchange currently publishes a Regulatory Closing Imbalance at the Closing Auction Imbalance Freeze Time if the Closing Imbalance is 500 round lots or more. The Exchange proposes to retire the Regulatory Closing Imbalance based on a static round-lot trigger and instead publish a Significant Closing Imbalance based on a dynamic formula that would consider the notional size of the imbalance and the recent closing activity of the relevant security. As proposed, unless determined otherwise by the Exchange and announced by Trader Update, a Closing Imbalance would be considered “Significant” if:</P>

                    For purposes of calculating the proposed Significant Closing Imbalance, Average Closing Size would be calculated for each symbol based on the most recent 20 trading days where the security closed on a last sale eligible trade. For securities with less than the specified trading data, including but not limited to IPOs, direct listings, and transfers, the Closing Imbalance would be considered Significant if the notional value of the Closing Imbalance, calculated as the product of the imbalance quantity and the reference price, is equal to or greater than $200,000 for S&amp;P and all other securities or an alternative specified dollar amount as determined by the Exchange and announced by Trader Update. Only trading days with an NYSE close would be considered for purposes of the Significant Closing Imbalance calculation.

                <P>Finally, the Exchange proposes to include Closing D Orders earlier in the imbalance information provided to the marketplace. The Exchange disseminates two types of Imbalance publications: Total Imbalance and Closing Imbalance. Total Imbalance information is disseminated for all Auctions, and Closing Imbalance information is disseminated for the Closing Auction only.</P>
                <P>NYSE Rule 7.35(a)(4)(A)(i) provides that “Total Imbalance” means for the Core Open and Trading Halt Auctions, the Imbalance of all orders eligible to participate in an Auction and for the Closing Auction, the Imbalance of MOC, LOC, and Closing IO Orders, and beginning five minutes before the scheduled end of Core Trading Hours, Closing D Orders.</P>
                <P>In addition, for the Closing Auction, the Exchange provides information on the “Paired Quantity,” which is the volume of better-priced and at-priced buy shares that can be paired with better-priced and at-priced sell shares at the Imbalance Reference Price, and “Unpaired Quantity,” meaning the volume of better-priced and at-priced buy shares that cannot be paired with both at-priced and better-priced sell shares at the Imbalance Reference Price. Paired and Unpaired Quantity as defined in NYSE Rule 7.35(a)(4)(B)(ii) to include MOC, LOC, and Closing IO Orders, and beginning five minutes before the scheduled end of Core Trading Hours, Closing D Orders.</P>
                <P>Further, NYSE Rule 7.35(b) sets forth general rules for how different types of orders are ranked for purposes of how they are included in Auction Imbalance Information or for an Auction allocation. NYSE Rule 7.35(b)(1) provides that orders are ranked based on the price at which they would participate in an Auction. The price at which an order would be ranked would be used to determine whether it is a better-priced or an at-priced order. In this regard, beginning five minutes before the end of Core Trading Hours, the ranked price of a Closing D Order is the order's undisplayed discretionary price. In addition, under NYSE Rule 7.35(b)(2), the working time of a Closing D Order would be the later of its entry time or five minutes before the end of Core Trading Hours.</P>
                <P>
                    The Exchange proposes to amend these rules. The Exchange states that it believes that earlier inclusion of this order type in the imbalance information published by the Exchange would enhance the information available to the marketplace leading into the Closing Auction.

                     The Exchange also states that it believes that including Closing D Orders in its publicly disseminated imbalance information earlier would provide more information to the marketplace about the volume and type of orders going into the Closing Auction as well as additional time for the market to respond to any auction imbalances.

                    <FTREF/>
                     In particular, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
                    <SU>27</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

                </FTNT>
                <P>The Commission believes that the proposed rule change to include Closing D Orders in the Closing Auction Imbalance Information published by the Exchange beginning ten minutes before the scheduled end of Core Trading Hours, rather than the current five minutes, is reasonably designed to enhance the information available to the marketplace leading into the Closing Auction and to provide additional time for the market to respond to auction imbalances. The Commission also believes that the proposal to publish a Significant Closing Imbalance based on a dynamic formula—rather than the current Regulatory Closing Imbalance at the Closing Auction Imbalance Freeze Time if the Closing Imbalance is 500 round lots or more—is reasonably designed to provide meaningful information to market participants about interest in a security and to assist market participants in trading in the Closing Auction in that security. Moreover, allowing the Exchange the flexibility to determine the percentage amounts and notional value in the formula for what would constitute a Significant Closing Imbalance is reasonably designed to enable the Exchange to take market movements and the characteristics of different securities into consideration and to update the metrics if needed. Finally, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the Exchange to determine the Imbalance Reference Price for the Closing Auction in a security in the same way the Exchange currently determines the Imbalance Reference Price for the Closing Auction Imbalance Information, because this change would enhance consistency in the Exchange's rulebook and because bounding the Imbalance Reference Price by the BBO is reasonably designed to keep the Imbalance Reference Price in line with actual trading in that security.</P>
                <P>Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act.</P>

                <P>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
                <P>The purpose of this filing is to amend the Fee Schedule to replace the Ratio Threshold Fee with an Excessive Bandwidth Utilization Fee to reflect the Exchange's migration to NYSE Pillar (“Pillar”). The Exchange proposes to implement the fee changes effective June 12, 2024.</P>
                <P>The Exchange imposes certain fees to discourage excessive message traffic (that do not result in executions or otherwise improve market quality) that could unnecessarily tax the Exchange's resources, bandwidth, and capacity, as no system has unlimited capacity.</P>
                <P>With the Exchange's migration to the Pillar trading platform, market participants can send both quote and order message traffic over a single connection. This functionality allows the Exchange to monitor the message traffic of each OTP Holder or OTP Firm (collectively, “OTP Holders”), which in turn impacts how the Exchange calculates (and assess fees for) each OTP Holder's use of Exchange bandwidth and processing resources.</P>
                <P>
                    Currently, the Exchange assesses a Ratio Threshold Fee that is based on the number of orders entered as compared to the number of executions received in a calendar month.
                    <SU>5</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     To reflect the communication protocol available on Pillar, the Exchange proposes to replace the Ratio Threshold Fee with a “Monthly Excessive Bandwidth Utilization Fee” or “EBUF”.
                    <SU>6</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Like the Ratio Threshold Fee, the proposed EBUF is designed to strike the right balance between deterring OTP Holders from submitting an excessive number of messages (that do not result in executions or otherwise improve market quality) without discouraging OTP Holders from accessing the Exchange, except that it will include quotes. As proposed, the EBUF will only be assessed on OTP Holders that send more than 50 million messages per day on average during a calendar month.

                    <FTREF/>

                    The proposed EBUF would calculate an OTP Holder's “Monthly Message to Execution Ratio” (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     the number of messages sent versus the number of executions). The Exchange has determined that, on Pillar, setting a baseline threshold for this “Monthly Message to Execution Ratio” at 500,000 to 1 or greater should ensure the efficient use of the Exchange's resources, bandwidth, and capacity by OTP Holders that are actively trading on the Exchange. Thus, as proposed, the Exchange will calculate the number of messages submitted by an OTP Holder, and the number of executions by the OTP Holder, and will only assess the EBUF if the Monthly Message to Execution Ratio exceeds 500,000 to 1. The proposed Fee will be assessed to further encourage efficient use of the Exchange's resources as shown here:

                    Like the Ratio Threshold Fee, the higher the Messages to Executions Ratio (

                     the more unexecuted message that Pillar ingests), the higher the proposed fee, which increase is designed to discourage (increasing levels of) excessive message traffic by OTP Holders. The Exchange notes that the proposed minimum thresholds for triggering the proposed EBUF are higher than the thresholds associated with the Ratio Threshold Fee (but the associated fees are substantially the same), which reflects the fact that both quotes and orders (and cancellations or modification thereof) are “messages” included in the calculation as well as the fact that Pillar can accommodate more message traffic than the Exchange's pre-Pillar system.

                    proposed EBUF thresholds are set at levels that an OTP Holder should not hit or exceed in the ordinary course of trading. As such, the Exchange believes that the proposed EBUF thresholds and associated fees are set at levels reasonable designed to encourage OTP Holders to efficiently use message traffic as necessary.

                        of between 10,000 and 14,999 to 1, with an accompanying fee of $5,000; between 15,000 and 19,999 to 1, with an accompanying fee of $10,000; between 20,000 and 24,999 to 1, with an accompanying fee of $20,000; and 25,000 to 1 and greater, with an accompanying fee of $35,000.

                    In addition, like the Ratio Threshold Fee, the Exchange will not assess the EBUF for an OTP Holder's first occurrence in a rolling twelve-month period (the “Exemption”).
                    <SU>10</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     For example, an OTP Holder that exceeds the minimum EBUF threshold in October 2024 will not be assessed the EBUF as long as that OTP Holder does not exceed the minimum EBUF threshold again before October 2025. If that same OTP Holder exceeds the minimum EBUF threshold in December 2025, it will not incur the EBUF if it does not exceed the minimum EBUF before December 2026. As noted above, an OTP Holder should not exceed the EBUF in its normal course of trading. Therefore, the proposed Exemption acts as a guardrail of sorts that is designed to protect OTP Holders from incurring the EBUF when they first encounter lower than expected executions in a rolling twelve-month period, such as when they are new to the Pillar trading platform, deploying new technologies, or testing different trading strategies, thereby encouraging OTP Holders to maintain their trading activity on the Exchange by mitigating the initial impact of the EBUF.

                <P>The Exchange believes that the proposed EBUF is reasonable, equitable, and not unfairly discriminatory because it is designed to strike the right balance between deterring OTP Holders from submitting an excessive number of messages that do not result in an execution (or improve market quality) without discouraging OTP Holders from accessing the Exchange. To the extent that the proposed EBUF results in the efficient use of the Exchange's finite resources, all market participant stand to benefit from improved market quality.</P>
                <P>The Exchange believes that the proposed minimum EBUF thresholds, which are higher than the thresholds associated with the Ratio Threshold Fee (but carry roughly the same incremental fees), are reasonable because, unlike the Ratio Threshold Fee, the proposed EBUF counts a broader category of “message,” including quotes, orders, order cancellations, and modifications. Therefore, the Exchange believes the EBUF appropriately accounts for the significantly wider category of “messages” now included and accounts for the increased capacity available to Exchange participants on the Pillar trading system. Given that the proposed EBUF is meant to operate as a guardrail of sorts that an OTP Holder should not “hit” or exceed in the ordinary course of trading, the Exchange proposes to set the EBUF thresholds at levels reasonably designed to encourage OTP Holders to efficiently use message traffic as necessary.</P>
                <P>The Exchange believes that the proposed Exemption is reasonable, equitable, and not unfairly discriminatory because is designed to protect OTP Holders from incurring the EBUF when they first encounter lower than expected executions in a rolling twelve-month period, such as when they are new to the Pillar trading platform, deploying new technologies, or testing different trading strategies, thereby encouraging OTP Holders to maintain their trading activity on the Exchange by mitigating the initial impact of the EBUF. The Exchange believes the proposed Exemption is reasonable as it is intended to lessen the initial impact of the EBUF while affording OTP Holders an opportunity to moderate or fine tune their message rates as needed once- every-twelve-months.</P>
                <P>The proposed EBUF is a reasonable, equitable, and not unfairly discriminatory because it neither targets nor will it have a disparate impact on any category of market participant. The proposed EBUF would impact all similarly situated OTP Holders on an equal basis; all OTP Holders would be eligible for the Exemption the first time they incur the EBUF in a rolling 12-month period.</P>
                <P>The Exchange believes that the removal of the obsolete text from the Fee Schedule (regarding the Ratio Threshold Fee and associated stale waiver language) would further the protection of investors and the public interest by promoting clarity and transparency in Fee Schedule thereby making the Fee Schedule easier to navigate and understand.</P>

                     The Exchange believes the proposed EBUF, including the Exemption, would not place an unfair burden on intramarket competition because it is designed to encourage efficient and rational use of the Exchange's finite resources and would apply to all market participants.

                <P>The deletion of the language relating to the Ratio Threshold Fee Waiver would remove language from the Fee Schedule no longer applicable to any OTP Holders and, accordingly, would not have any impact on intramarket competition.

                     The Exchange believes the proposed EBUF, including the Exemption, would not place an unfair burden on intermarket competition as it is not intended to address any competitive issues but is instead designed solely to encourage the efficient use of the Exchange's

                <P>The Exchange proposes to amend its Fee Schedule applicable to its equities trading platform (“BZX Equities”) by modifying the Add Volume Tier. The Exchange proposes to implement these changes effective June 3, 2024.</P>
                <P>
                    The Exchange first notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be excessive or incentives to be insufficient. More specifically, the Exchange is only one of 16 registered equities exchanges, as well as a number of alternative trading systems and other off-exchange venues that do not have similar self-regulatory responsibilities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”), to which market participants may direct their order flow. Based on publicly available information,
                    <SU>3</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     no single registered equities exchange has more than 15% of the market share. Thus, in such a low-concentrated and highly competitive market, no single equities exchange possesses significant pricing power in the execution of order flow. The Exchange in particular operates a “Maker-Taker” model whereby it pays rebates to members that add liquidity and assesses fees to those that remove liquidity. The Exchange's Fee Schedule sets forth the standard rebates and rates applied per share for orders that provide and remove liquidity, respectively. Currently, for orders in securities priced at or above $1.00, the Exchange provides a standard rebate of $0.00160 per share for orders that add liquidity and assesses a fee of $0.0030 per share for orders that remove liquidity.
                    <SU>4</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     For orders in securities priced below $1.00, the Exchange does not provide a rebate for orders that add liquidity and assesses a fee of 0.30% of the total dollar value for orders that remove liquidity.
                    <SU>5</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Additionally, in response to the competitive environment, the Exchange also offers tiered pricing which provides Members opportunities to qualify for higher rebates or reduced fees where certain volume criteria and thresholds are met. Tiered pricing provides an incremental incentive for Members to strive for higher tier levels, which provides increasingly higher benefits or discounts for satisfying increasingly more stringent criteria.

                <P>In conjunction with the new, proposed Add Volume Tier 8, the Exchange proposes to renumber the current Add Volume Tier 8 as Add Volume Tier 9. Additionally, the Exchange proposes to amend the third prong of criteria associated with proposed Add Volume Tier 9 (current Add Volume Tier 8) and increase the rebate associated with the tier from $0.0031 per share in securities priced at or above $1.00 to $0.0032 per share. The current criteria for proposed Add Volume Tier 9 (current Add Volume Tier 8) is as follows:</P>
                <P>
                    • Proposed Add Volume Tier 9 (current Add Volume Tier 8) provides a rebate of $0.0031 per share in securities priced at or above $1.00 to qualifying orders (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     orders yielding fee codes B, V, or Y) where a Member: (1) has an ADAV as a percentage of TCV ≥0.42%; and (2) Member has a Tape B ADV ≥1.50% of the Tape B TCV; and (3) Member has a Remove ADV ≥0.30% of the TCV.
                </P>
                <P>The proposed criteria for proposed Add Volume Tier 9 is as follows:</P>
                <P>
                    • Proposed Add Volume Tier 9 provides a rebate of $0.0032 per share in securities priced at or above $1.00 to qualifying orders (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     orders yielding fee codes B, V, or Y) where a Member: (1) has an ADAV as a percentage of TCV ≥0.42%; and 92) Member has a Tape B ADV ≥1.50% of the Tape B TCV; and (3) Member has a Remove ADV ≥0.20% of the TCV.
                </P>
                <P>The proposed, new Add Volume Tier 8 and the proposed Add Volume Tier 9 are intended to continue to provide an additional opportunity to incentivize Members to earn an enhanced rebate by increasing their order flow to the Exchange, which further contributes to a deeper, more liquid market and provides even more execution opportunities for active market participants. The Exchange believes that the proposed, new Add Volume Tier 8 and proposed Add Volume Tier 9 continue to offer an enhanced rebate that is commensurate with the proposed criteria, which is not significantly more difficult nor significantly easier than the current criteria found in the Add Volume Tiers. Incentivizing an increase in liquidity adding volume through enhanced rebate opportunities encourages liquidity-adding Members on the Exchange to increase transactions and take execution opportunities provided by such increased liquidity, together providing for overall enhanced price discovery and price improvement opportunities on the Exchange. As such, increased overall order flow benefits all Members by contributing towards a robust and well-balanced market ecosystem.</P>

                    As described above, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be excessive or incentives to be insufficient. The Exchange believes that its proposal to modify the Add Volume Tiers reflects a competitive pricing structure designed to incentivize market participants to direct their order flow to the Exchange, which the Exchange believes would enhance market quality to the benefit of all Members. Specifically, the Exchange's proposed, new Add Volume Tier 8 and proposed Add Volume Tier 9 are not a significant departure from existing criteria, are reasonably correlated to the enhanced rebate offered by the Exchange and other competing exchanges,

                     and are reasonable, equitable and non-discriminatory because they are open to all Members on an equal basis and provide additional benefits or discounts that are reasonably related to (i) the value to an exchange's market quality and (ii) associated higher levels of market activity, such as higher levels of liquidity provision and/or growth patterns. Competing equity exchanges offer similar tiered pricing structures, including schedules or rebates and fees that apply based upon members achieving certain volume and/or growth thresholds, as well as assess similar fees or rebates for similar types of orders, to that of the Exchange.

                <P>In particular, the Exchange believes its proposal to introduce a new Add Volume Tier 8 and renumber current Add Volume Tier 8 as proposed Add Volume Tier 9 with amended criteria is reasonable because the proposed tiers will be available to all Members and provide all Members with an opportunity to receive an enhanced rebate. The Exchange further believes its proposal to introduce a new Add Volume Tier 8 and renumber current Add Volume Tier 8 as proposed Add Volume Tier 9 with amended criteria will provide a reasonable means to encourage liquidity adding displayed orders in Members' order flow to the Exchange and to incentivize Members to continue to provide liquidity adding and liquidity removing volume to the Exchange by offering them an opportunity to receive an enhanced rebate on qualifying orders. An overall increase in activity would deepen the Exchange's liquidity pool, offer additional cost savings, support the quality of price discovery, promote market transparency and improve market quality, for all investors.</P>
                <P>The Exchange believes that its proposal to introduce a new Add Volume Tier 8 and renumber current Add Volume Tier 8 as proposed Add Volume Tier 9 with amended criteria is reasonable as the proposed criteria does not represent a significant departure from the criteria currently offered in the Fee Schedule. The Exchange also believes that the proposal represents an equitable allocation of fees and rebates and is not unfairly discriminatory because all Members will be eligible for the proposed a new Add Volume Tier 8 and proposed Add Volume Tier 9 and have the opportunity to meet the tiers' criteria and receive the corresponding enhanced rebate if such criteria is met. Without having a view of activity on other markets and off-exchange venues, the Exchange has no way of knowing whether this proposed rule change would definitely result in any Members qualifying for proposed Add Volume Tier 8 and proposed Add Volume Tier 9. While the Exchange has no way of predicting with certainty how the proposed changes will impact Member activity, based on the prior month's volume, the Exchange anticipates that at least one Member will be able to satisfy proposed Add Volume Tier 8 and at least one Member will be able to satisfy proposed Add Volume Tier 9. The Exchange also notes that proposed changes will not adversely impact any Member's ability to qualify for enhanced rebates offered under other tiers. Should a Member not meet the proposed new criteria, the Member will merely not receive that corresponding enhanced rebate.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>
                <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Rather, as discussed above, the Exchange believes that the proposed change would encourage the submission of additional order flow to a public exchange, thereby promoting market depth, execution incentives and enhanced execution opportunities, as well as price discovery and transparency for all Members. As a result, the Exchange believes that the proposed changes further the Commission's goal in adopting Regulation NMS of fostering competition among orders, which promotes “more efficient pricing of individual stocks for all types of orders, large and small.”</P>
                <P>The Exchange believes the proposed rule changes do not impose any burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Particularly, the Exchange's proposal to introduce new Add Volume Tier 8 and renumber current Add Volume Tier 8 as proposed Add Volume Tier 9 with amended criteria will apply to all Members equally in that all Members are eligible for the proposed tiers, have a reasonable opportunity to meet the proposed tiers' criteria and will receive the enhanced rebate on their qualifying orders if such criteria is met. The Exchange does not believe the proposed changes burden competition, but rather, enhance competition as they are intended to increase the competitiveness of BZX by amending existing pricing incentives in order to attract order flow and incentivize participants to increase their participation on the Exchange, providing for additional execution opportunities for market participants and improved price transparency. Greater overall order flow, trading opportunities, and pricing transparency benefits all market participants on the Exchange by enhancing market quality and continuing to encourage Members to send orders, thereby contributing towards a robust and well-balanced market ecosystem.</P>
                <P>
                    Next, the Exchange believes the proposed rule changes does not impose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As previously discussed, the Exchange 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51926"/>
                    operates in a highly competitive market. Members have numerous alternative venues that they may participate on and direct their order flow, including other equities exchanges, off-exchange venues, and alternative trading systems. Additionally, the Exchange represents a small percentage of the overall market. Based on publicly available information, no single equities exchange has more than 15% of the market share.
                    <SU>19</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Therefore, no exchange possesses significant pricing power in the execution of order flow. Indeed, participants can readily choose to send their orders to other exchange and off-exchange venues if they deem fee levels at those other venues to be more favorable. Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining prices, products, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, in Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the market system “has been remarkably successful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that are most important to investors and listed companies.” 
                    <SU>20</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     The fact that this market is competitive has also long been recognized by the courts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. Circuit stated as follows: “[n]o one disputes that competition for order flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC explained, `[i]n the U.S. national market system, buyers and sellers of securities, and the broker-dealers that act as their order-routing agents, have a wide range of choices of where to route orders for execution'; [and] `no exchange can afford to take its market share percentages for granted' because `no exchange possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in the execution of order flow from broker dealers'. . . .”.
                    <SU>21</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Accordingly, the Exchange does not believe its proposed fee change imposes any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

                <P>The Exchange proposes to amend its Fee Schedule applicable to its equities trading platform (“BYX Equities”) by modifying the description associated with fee code MT. The Exchange proposes to implement these changes effective June 3, 2024.</P>
                <P>
                    The Exchange first notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be excessive or incentives to be insufficient. More specifically, the Exchange is only one of 16 registered equities exchanges, as well as a number of alternative trading systems and other off-exchange venues that do not have similar self-regulatory responsibilities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”), to which market participants may direct their order flow. Based on publicly available information,
                    <SU>3</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     no single registered equities exchange has more than 15% of the market share. Thus, in such a low-concentrated and highly competitive market, no single equities exchange possesses significant pricing power in the execution of order flow. The Exchange in particular operates a “Taker-Maker” model whereby it pays credits to members that remove liquidity and assesses fees to those that add liquidity. The Exchange's Fee Schedule sets forth the standard rebates and rates applied per share for orders that remove and provide liquidity, respectively. Currently, for orders in securities priced at or above $1.00, the Exchange provides a standard rebate of $0.00200 per share for orders that remove liquidity and assesses a fee of $0.00200 per share for orders that add liquidity.
                    <SU>4</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     For orders in securities priced below $1.00, the Exchange does not assess any fees for orders that add liquidity, and provides a rebate in the amount of 0.10% of the total dollar value for orders that remove liquidity.
                    <SU>5</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Additionally, in response to the competitive environment, the Exchange also offers tiered pricing which provides Members opportunities to qualify for higher rebates or reduced fees where certain volume criteria and thresholds are met. Tiered pricing provides an incremental incentive for Members to strive for higher tier levels, which provides increasingly higher benefits or discounts for satisfying increasingly more stringent criteria.

                <P>
                    Fee code MT is appended to orders that remove Mid-Point Peg liquidity from BYX. A Mid-Point Peg Order is a limit order that after entry into the System,
                    <SU>6</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     the price of the order is automatically adjusted by the System in response to changes in the NBBO to be pegged to the mid-point of the NBBO, or, alternatively, pegged to the less aggressive of the midpoint of the NBBO or one minimum price variation inside the same side of the NBBO as the order.
                    <SU>7</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Based on customer feedback, the Exchange proposes to amend the description of fee code MT in order to clarify when the fee code is appended to orders. The Exchange believes that amending the description of fee code MT to state that it will be appended to orders that remove liquidity designated as Mid-Point Peg orders more accurately captures the alternative scenario described in Rule 11.9(c)(9) where a Mid-Point Peg Order is pegged to one minimum price variation inside the same side of the NBBO as the order. This change will not affect when fee code MT is appended to an order and only serves to clarify to Members when an order may be designated with fee code MT.

                    As described above, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be excessive or incentives to be insufficient. The Exchange believes that its proposal to amend the description associated with fee code MT is reasonable, equitable, and consistent with the Act because such change is designed to provide additional clarity to Members as to which orders may be appended with fee code MT without changing how fee code MT is currently applied to orders. The Exchange further believes that the proposed amendment to the description associated with fee code MT is not unfairly discriminatory because it applies to all Members equally, in that 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51928"/>
                    the amended description will apply to all Members and fee code MT will be applied to all orders matching the revised description.
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>
                <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Rather, as discussed above, the Exchange believes that the proposed change would encourage the submission of additional order flow to a public exchange, thereby promoting market depth, execution incentives and enhanced execution opportunities, as well as price discovery and transparency for all Members. As a result, the Exchange believes that the proposed changes further the Commission's goal in adopting Regulation NMS of fostering competition among orders, which promotes “more efficient pricing of individual stocks for all types of orders, large and small.”</P>
                <P>The Exchange believes the proposed revised description associated with fee code MT does not impose any burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed description associated with fee code MT would apply to all Members equally in that all Members would be subject to the revised definition and fee code MT will be applied to all orders matching the revised description.</P>
                <P>
                    Next, the Exchange believes the proposed rule changes does not impose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As previously discussed, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market. Members have numerous alternative venues that they may participate on and direct their order flow, including other equities exchanges, off-exchange venues, and alternative trading systems. Additionally, the Exchange represents a small percentage of the overall market. Based on publicly available information, no single equities exchange has more than 15% of the market share.
                    <SU>12</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Therefore, no exchange possesses significant pricing power in the execution of order flow. Indeed, participants can readily choose to send their orders to other exchange and off-exchange venues if they deem fee levels at those other venues to be more favorable. Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining prices, products, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, in Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the market system “has been remarkably successful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that are most important to investors and listed companies.” 
                    <SU>13</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     The fact that this market is competitive has also long been recognized by the courts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. Circuit stated as follows: “[n]o one disputes that competition for order flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC explained, `[i]n the U.S. national market system, buyers and sellers of securities, and the broker-dealers that act as their order-routing agents, have a wide range of choices of where to route orders for execution'; [and] `no exchange can afford to take its market share percentages for granted' because `no exchange possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in the execution of order flow from broker dealers'. . . .” 
                    <SU>14</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Accordingly, the Exchange does not believe its proposed fee change imposes any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

                <P>
                    The Exchange proposes to introduce a new connectivity offering relating to the use of Dedicated Cores. By way of background, all Central Processing Units (“CPU Cores”) have historically been shared by logical order entry ports (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     multiple logical ports from multiple firms may connect to a single CPU Core). Starting June 10, 2024, the Exchange will allow Users

                    <FTREF/>
                     to assign a single Binary Order Entry (“BOE”) logical order entry port 
                    <SU>6</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     to a single dedicated CPU Core (“Dedicated Core”).
                    <SU>7</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Use of Dedicated Cores can provide reduced latency, enhanced throughput, and improved performance since a firm using a Dedicated Core is utilizing the full processing power of a CPU Core instead of sharing that power with other firms. This offering is completely voluntary and will be available to all Users.
                    <SU>8</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Users will also continue to have the option to utilize BOE logical order entry ports on shared CPU Cores as they do today, either in lieu of, or in addition to, their use of Dedicated Core(s). As such, Users will be able to operate across a mix of shared and dedicated CPU Cores which the Exchange believes provides additional risk and capacity management, especially during times of market volatility and high message traffic. Further, Dedicated Cores are not required nor necessary to participate on the Exchange and as such Users may opt not to use Dedicated Cores at all.

                    In particular, the proposal would provide Users the option to assign a single BOE logical entry port to a single Dedicated Core. As described above, CPU Cores have historically been shared by logical order entry ports (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     multiple logical ports from multiple firms may connect to a single CPU Core). Use of Dedicated Cores can provide reduced latency, enhanced throughput, and improved performance since a firm using a Dedicated Core is utilizing the full processing power of a CPU Core instead of sharing that power with other firms. The Exchange also emphasizes that the use of Dedicated Cores is not necessary for trading and as noted above, is entirely optional. Indeed, Users can continue to access the Exchange through shared CPU Cores at no additional cost. Depending on a firm's specific business needs, the proposal enables Users to choose to use Dedicated Cores in lieu of, or in addition to, shared CPU Cores (or as noted, not use Dedicated Cores at all). The Exchange also notes that its affiliated exchanges, Cboe EDGA Exchange, Inc., Cboe BYX Exchange, 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51930"/>
                    Inc., and Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. recently introduced Dedicated Cores and that another Exchange [sic] also provides a similar connectivity offering.

                <P>Furthermore, this service is optional and is available to all Users.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>
                <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Particularly, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change does not impose any burden on intra-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because Dedicated Cores will be available to all Users. While the Exchange believes that the proposed Dedicated Cores provide a valuable service, Users can choose to purchase, or not purchase, Dedicated Cores based on their own determination of the value and their business needs. Indeed, no User is required or under any regulatory obligation to use Dedicated Cores.</P>
                <P>
                    Additionally, nothing in the proposal imposes any burden on the ability of other exchanges to compete. The Exchange operates in a highly competitive market in which exchanges offer various connectivity services as a means to facilitate the trading and other market activities of those market participants and at least one other exchange has an offering comparable to Dedicated Cores.

                     Additionally, the Exchange offers historical reports containing both the end-of-day volume and end-of-month trading activity. The fee per month of historical data is $500. The Short Volume Report provided on a historical basis is only for display use redistribution (

                    Therefore, Users of the historical data may not charge separately for data included in the Short Volume Report or incorporate such data into their product.

For example, if a User subscribes to the Report on October 24, 2023, the monthly fee will cover the period of October 24, 2023, through November 23, 2023. If the User cancels its subscription prior to November 23, 2023, and no refund is issued, the User will continue to receive both the end-of-day and end-of-month components of the Report for the subscription period.

                    The Exchange proposes to provide a temporary pricing incentive program in which Members or Non-Members that purchase historical Short Volume Reports will receive a percentage fee discount where specific purchase thresholds are met. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to provide a 20% discount for ad-hoc purchases of historical Short Volume Reports of $20,000 or more.

                     The proposed program will apply to all market participants irrespective of whether the market participant is a new or current purchaser; however, the discount cannot be combined with any other discounts offered by the Exchange. The Exchange intends to introduce the discount program beginning June 4, 2024, with the program remaining in effect through June 30, 2024. The Exchange also notes that it previously adopted the same discount program last year and proposes to update the Fees Schedule with the new program dates accordingly.

                    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data. The Exchange believes that the proposed fee changes will further broaden the availability of U.S. equity market data to investors consistent with the principles of Regulation NMS. The Exchange believes the dissemination of historical short volume data via historical Short Volume Reports benefits investors through increased transparency and may promote better informed trading, as well as research and studies of the equities industry. Nevertheless, the Exchange notes that such data is not necessary for trading and as noted above, is entirely optional. Moreover, several other exchanges offer a similar data product which offer the same type of data content through similar reports.

                    The Exchange operates in a highly competitive environment. Indeed, there are currently 16 registered equities exchanges that trade equities. Based on publicly available information, no single equities exchange has more than 16% of the equity market share.

                     The Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining prices, products, and services in the securities markets. Particularly, in Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the market system “has been remarkably successful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that are most important to investors and listed companies.”

                     Making similar data products available to market participants fosters competition in the marketplace, and constrains the ability of exchanges to charge supercompetitive fees. In the event that a market participant views one exchange's data product as more attractive than the competition, that market participant can, and often does, switch between similar products. The proposed fees are a result of the competitive environment of the U.S. equities industry as the Exchange seeks to adopt fees to attract purchasers of historical Short Volume Reports.

                    The Exchange believes that the proposed incentive program for any Member or non-Member who purchases historical Short Volume Reports is reasonable because such purchasers would receive a 20% discount for purchasing $20,000 or more worth of historical Short Volume Reports. The Exchange believes the proposed discount is reasonable as it will give purchasers the ability to use and test the historical Short Volume Reports at a discounted rate, prior to purchasing additional months or a monthly subscription, and will therefore encourage users to purchase historical Short Volume Reports. Further, the proposed discount is intended to promote increased use of the Exchange's historical Short Volume Reports by defraying some of the costs a purchaser would ordinarily have to expend before using the data product. The Exchange believes that the proposed discount is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because it will apply equally to all Members and non-Members who purchase historical Short Volume Reports. Lastly, the purchase of this data product is discretionary and not compulsory. Indeed, no market participant is required to purchase the historical Short Volume Reports, and the Exchange is not required to make historical Short Volume Reports available to all investors. Potential purchasers may request the data at any time if they believe it to be valuable or may decline to purchase such data. As noted above, the Exchange previously 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51933"/>
                    adopted a similar discount program last year.

                <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange operates in a highly competitive environment in which the Exchange must continually adjust its fees to remain competitive. Because competitors are free to modify their own fees in response, the Exchange believes that the degree to which fee changes in this market may impose any burden on competition is extremely limited. As discussed above, the Exchange's historical Short Volume Reports offering is subject to direct competition from several other options exchanges that offer similar data products. Moreover, purchase of historical Short Volume Reports is optional. It is designed to help investors understand underlying market trends to improve the quality of investment decisions, but is not necessary to execute a trade.</P>
                <P>The proposed rule changes are grounded in the Exchange's efforts to compete more effectively. In this competitive environment, potential purchasers are free to choose which, if any, similar product to purchase to satisfy their need for market information. As a result, the Exchange believes this proposed rule change permits fair competition among national securities exchanges. Further, the Exchange believes that these changes will not cause any unnecessary or inappropriate burden on intermarket competition, as the proposed incentive program applies uniformly to any purchaser of historical Short Volume Reports.</P>

                    The rail cost adjustment factor (RCAF) is an index formulated to represent changes in railroad costs incurred by the nation's largest railroads over a specified period of time. Under 49 U.S.C. 10708, the Surface Transportation Board (Board) is required to publish the RCAF on at least a quarterly basis. Each quarter, the Association of American Railroads computes three types of RCAF figures and submits those figures to the Board for approval. The Board has reviewed the submission and adopts the RCAF figures for the third quarter of 2024. The third quarter 2024 RCAF (Unadjusted) is 0.950. The third quarter 2024 RCAF (Adjusted) is 0.372. The third quarter 2024 RCAF-5 is 0.353. Additional information is contained in the Board's decision, which is available at

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
                <P>President Biden first announced the Partnership at the 2022 Summit of the Americas. On November 3, 2023, the United States welcomed representatives of the founding Partnership countries to the White House for the first Leaders' Summit. Following the Summit, leaders of the United States, Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru and Uruguay released the East Room Declaration, which directs Ministers to begin work in three tracks—Foreign Affairs, Trade, and Finance—to support the Leaders' intention that the Partnership serve as a lasting regional platform to pursue an ambitious, flexible and goal-oriented regional economic and development agenda. Leaders further identified five initial cross-cutting priorities:</P>
                <P>• Strengthening regional competitiveness and integration;</P>
                <P>• Fostering shared prosperity and good governance;</P>
                <P>• Building sustainable infrastructure;</P>
                <P>• Protecting the climate and environment; and</P>
                <P>• Promoting healthy communities.</P>
                <P>Leaders also called on Ministers responsible for trade to develop inclusive and sustainable approaches to trade and investment that will support regional sustainable development and resilient supply chains for goods and services, enhance a predictable and transparent regulatory environment that can boost trade flows, and remove barriers to greater economic integration among our countries.</P>
                <P>On March 18, 2024, the Partnership Trade Ministers met virtually. They took note of the work of the Partnership's Council on Trade and Competitiveness (CTC), which is comprised of senior officials for trade. The CTC has established committees on Trade Rules and Transparency, Sustainable Value and Supply Chains, and Inclusive Trade and SMEs.</P>
                <P>The Ministers emphasized how the Partnership can complement and build on existing trade ties, further deepen economic integration in the region, and develop sustainable and inclusive approaches to trade and investment. They also recalled Leaders' expectation that the trade agenda under the Partnership promote formal jobs that lead to decent work and promote internationally recognized labor rights, environmental sustainability, and economic inclusion.</P>
                <P>Trade Ministers plan to meet in person in Ecuador in August 2024 to review progress by the CTC and discuss priorities for next year. Ministers also will discuss preparation for the Leaders' Summit in Costa Rica in 2025.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Public Comment</HD>
                <P>The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) invites interested parties to submit comments to assist USTR in the development of priorities and lines of effort consistent with the regional scope and collaborative nature of the Partnership, as elaborated below. Because the Partnership will build on, and coexist with, existing U.S trade agreements, its work should not detract from or unnecessarily duplicate work that is taking place in the committees of existing U.S trade agreements, including free trade agreements, trade and investment framework agreements, and other similar agreements.</P>
                <P>USTR is committed to broad and inclusive stakeholder engagement in developing projects for the trade work of the Partnership. In particular, the TPSC invites interested parties to comment on the following matters as they relate to trade and investment:</P>
                <P>• Customs and trade facilitation;</P>
                <P>
                    • Value and supply chain resilience and sustainability, with particular focus 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51936"/>
                    on clean energy, medical supplies and semiconductors;
                </P>
                <P>• Inclusive Trade, including for women, Indigenous Peoples, and other underrepresented groups;</P>
                <P>• Issues of particular relevance to small and medium-sized enterprises;</P>
                <P>• Labor standards and worker rights;</P>
                <P>• Environment, climate, and conservation;</P>
                <P>• Transparency and good regulatory practices;</P>
                <P>• Anti-corruption;</P>
                <P>• Trade capacity building needs and priorities; and</P>
                <P>• Other matters related to trade and investment in the Americas that are consistent with the mission and scope of the Partnership.</P>
                <P>USTR requests small businesses (generally defined by the Small Business Administration as firms with fewer than 500 employees) or organizations representing small business members that submit comments to self-identify as such, so that we may be aware of issues of particular interest to small businesses.</P>

Specifically, the Agency would like to hear from members of the public on issues of concern relating to the current Safety Fitness Determination (SFD), including, for example, the three-tiered rating system (Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Conditional) versus changing to a proposed single rating only when a carrier is found to be Unfit; utilizing inspection data and FMCSA's Safety Measurement System (SMS); incorporating driver behavior into SFD ratings; and revising the list of safety violations used to calculate the rating, and adjusting the weights allocated to particular violations including increasing the weight for unsafe driving violations. In a separate notice, FMCSA announced and provided registration information for a related in-person listening session on the same topics to be held in June 2024.</P>

                <P>FMCSA believes it is in the public interest to host two virtual public listening sessions to receive additional comments on possible updates to the Agency's SFD methodology and process. Accordingly, FMCSA is announcing these virtual listening sessions, being held on June 25 and July 31, 2024. FMCSA has also published another notice formally announcing, and providing separate registration information for, a related in-person listening session on the same topics to be held in Houston, TX in June 2024 (89 FR 48703, June 7, 2024).</P>
                <P>FMCSA is currently contemplating changes to its SFD process. To that end, the Agency published an ANPRM soliciting public input on the potential use of the SMS methodology to issue SFDs (88 FR 59489, Aug. 29, 2023). These virtual public listening sessions are intended to gain additional feedback on issues of concern relating to the current SFD, including, for example:</P>
                <P>• Continuing the current SFD three-tiered rating system (Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Conditional) versus changing to a proposed single rating, issued only when a carrier is found to be Unfit;</P>
                <P>• Utilizing inspection data and FMCSA's SMS;</P>
                <P>• Incorporating driver behavior into SFD ratings; and</P>
                <P>• Revising the list of safety violations used to calculate the rating, and adjusting the weights allocated to particular violations, including increasing the weight for 49 CFR 392.2 (unsafe driving) violations.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Meeting Participation</HD>
                <P>The virtual listening sessions are open to the public. Speakers' remarks will be limited to 3 minutes each.</P>

                <P>In general, Title 49 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 20157(h) requires FRA to certify that a host railroad's PTC system complies with Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 236, subpart I, before the technology may be operated in revenue service. Before making certain changes to an FRA-certified PTC system or the associated FRA-approved PTC Safety Plan (PTCSP), a host railroad must submit, and obtain FRA's approval of, an RFA to its PTC system or PTCSP under 49 CFR 236.1021.</P>
                <P>
                    Under 49 CFR 236.1021(e), FRA's regulations provide that FRA will publish a notice in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     and invite public comment in accordance with 49 CFR part 211, if an RFA includes a request for approval of a material modification of a signal or train control system. Accordingly, this notice informs the public that, on June 7, 2024, Metrolink submitted an RFA to its Interoperable Electronic Train Management System (I-ETMS), which seeks FRA's approval of a temporary I-ETMS outage to support pre-revenue service vehicle acceptance testing on a new vehicle type. That RFA is available in Docket No. FRA-2010-0048.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Interested parties are invited to comment on Metrolink's RFA by submitting written comments or data. During FRA's review of this railroad's RFA, FRA will consider any comments or data submitted within the timeline specified in this notice and to the extent practicable, without delaying implementation of valuable or necessary modifications to a PTC system. 
                    <E T="03">See</E>

                     49 CFR 236.1011(e). Under 49 CFR 236.1021, FRA maintains the authority to approve, approve with conditions, or deny a railroad's RFA at FRA's sole discretion.

                     The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century or “AIR-21” (Pub. L. 106-181), which was signed into law on April 5, 2000, includes section 710, “Reports by Carriers on Incidents Involving Animals During Air Transport.” This provision was codified as 49 U.S.C. 41721. The statute requires air carriers that provide scheduled passenger air transportation to submit monthly to the Secretary of Transportation a report on any incidents involving the loss, injury, or death of an animal (as defined by the Secretary of Transportation) during air transport provided by the air carrier.
                </P>
                <P>
                    On August 11, 2003, DOT, through its Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), issued a final rule implementing section 710 of AIR-21.
                    <SU>3</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     The rule required air carriers that provide scheduled passenger air transportation to submit a report to APHIS on any incident involving the loss, injury, or death of an animal during air transportation provided by the air carrier. Due to issues regarding whether APHIS had the capability to accept such information directly from the carriers, DOT made a technical change in the rule on February 14, 2005, to require air carriers to submit the required information directly to DOT's Aviation Consumer Protection Division (ACPD) rather than APHIS and to make the rule part of DOT's economic regulations.

                </FTNT>
                <P>
                    On July 3, 2014, DOT published a final rule amending the requirement that air carriers file reports with DOT on the loss, injury, or death of animals 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51940"/>
                    during air transport.

                    <FTREF/>
                     The rule (1) expanded the reporting requirement from the largest U.S. carriers (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     U.S. carriers that account for at least 1 percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenue) to U.S. carriers that operate scheduled service with at least one aircraft with a design capacity of more than 60 seats; (2) expanded the definition of “animal” from only a pet in a family household to include all cats and dogs transported by covered carriers, regardless of whether the cat or dog is transported as a pet by its owner or as part of a commercial shipment (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     shipped by a breeder); (3) required covered carriers to file a calendar-year report in December, even if the carrier did not have any reportable incidents during the calendar year; (4) required covered carriers to provide in their December reports the total number of animals that were lost, injured, or died during air transport in the calendar year; and (5) required covered carriers to provide in their December reports the total number of animals transported in the calendar year.

                <P>The ICR, “Reports by Air Carriers on Incidents Involving Animals During Air Transport,” OMB Control Number 2105-0552, was renewed twice: on August 25, 2015, OMB approved the reinstatement of the ICR through August 31, 2018, and on October 11, 2018, OMB approved the reinstatement of the ICR through October 31, 2021.</P>
                <P>The PRA and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, require Federal agencies to issue two notices seeking public comment on information collection activities before OMB may approve paperwork packages. A Federal agency generally cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information, and the public is generally not required to respond to an information collection, unless it is approved by the OMB under the PRA and displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, no person shall generally be subject to monetary penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information if the collection of information does not display a valid OMB Control Number.</P>
                <P>
                    As noted above, on January 24, 2024, DOT published a 60-day notice in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     soliciting comment on the reinstatement of this previously approved ICR. DOT received one comments in response to the notice. However, this comment is outside the scope of the ICR and does not discuss the proposed collection of information and the estimated burden.
                </P>
                <P>
                    DOT announces that this ICR has been re-evaluated and certified under 5 CFR 1320.5(a) and forwarded to OMB for review and approval pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.12(c). Before OMB decides whether to approve these proposed collections of information, it must provide 30 days for public comment.
                    <SU>6</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Federal law requires OMB to approve or disapprove paperwork packages between 30 and 60 days after the 30-day notice is published.
                    <SU>7</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     The 30-day notice informs the regulated community to file relevant comments and affords the agency adequate time to digest public comments before it renders a decision.
                    <SU>8</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Therefore, respondents should submit their respective comments to OMB within 30 days of publication to best ensure their full consideration. The summaries below describe the nature of the ICR and the expected burden. The unchanged requirements are being submitted for clearance by OMB as required by the PRA.

                    In Part 1 of this notice, FinCEN describes the distribution of the estimated number of covered financial institutions, by type, and the estimated number of new accounts opened per year, by type of covered financial institution. In addition, Part 1 describes the primary characteristics of covered financial institutions' CIP requirements. In Part 2, FinCEN proposes for review and comment a renewal of the calculation of the annual PRA burden that includes a scope and methodology similar to that used in the 2020 notice to renew the OMB control numbers associated with these information collections.

The public is invited to provide data, studies, or estimates that might revise this value. The current estimate is informed by consultation with staff from the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), which estimated that there are approximately 5,300,000 new accounts opened annually by credit unions with an FFR (based on the ten-year annual average growth rate in credit union membership computed using year end data from 2014 to 2023, as reported by Federally insured credit unions (FICUs)). It also includes an estimate of 4,005,000 new accounts opened annually by banks with an FFR, based on the observed number of bank-on accounts opened in calendar year 2022,

Applied to all banks lacking an FFR in the category (per financial institution new members annually: ((1,353,017/98) × 0.038) equals approximately 315,000 total new members annually per: 600 banks lacking an FFR multiplied by approximately 525 new members per financial institution.

                        ). FinCEN notes that this estimate of new accounts per year may be overinclusive because the ICI data utilized covers all U.S. registered funds, and not only mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Additionally, because this estimate reflects certain assumptions about the extent to which individuals who already invest in registered funds may open new accounts with different funds, it may approximate with greater imprecision the underlying number of unique new customers that are onboarded each year.

                         This estimate was formed in consultation with CFTC staff input based on data from the end of calendar year 2023. Because this estimate pertains to the number of new accounts opened in a one-year period, which may be numerically distinct from the number of customers (who open such accounts), it can be treated as a potential upper bound on the number of instances that would incur a distinct CIP compliance burden.

                    For all covered financial institutions, FinCEN continues estimating the incremental annual PRA recordkeeping burden associated with maintaining and updating the CIP (“maintenance”) at ten hours per financial institution. This estimate covers: (a) an average of approximately nine hours per financial 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51943"/>
                    institution per year associated with the burden of updating the records necessary to demonstrate compliance with CIP requirements to take into consideration any regulatory changes and any modifications required as a result of a financial institution making changes to the type of accounts maintained, the methods used to open accounts, and the types of documentary or non-documentary methods for verifying identifying information the financial institution intends to use; and (b) an average of approximately one hour per financial institution associated with the burden of presenting the updated CIP to the appropriate level of management within the financial institution and obtaining approval.
                </P>
                <P>In addition, FinCEN continues estimating the incremental annual PRA recordkeeping burden associated with providing customers with notification of the CIP (“notification”) at one hour per financial institution.</P>
                <P>
                    FinCEN also continues estimating the incremental annual PRA recordkeeping burden associated with obtaining and verifying a customer's identity (

                     verification and recordkeeping requirements, and consulting government lists) (“implementation”) at two minutes per new account opened.

                <P>
                    Under these assumptions, FinCEN's estimate of the annual incremental PRA burden is 1,989,452 hours, as detailed in tables 2 and 3.

                     The Secretary of VA has broad authority under Title 38 United States Code, section 501, to protect Veterans and their family members from fraud and enforce compliance with federal laws and regulations. The VA is an active participant in the cross-government Veteran Scam and Fraud Evasion (VSAFE) campaign and Task Force, and this information collection supports the goals for the reporting and resolution of potential fraud issues.
                </P>
                <P>The purpose of this information collection is to receive and process complaints related to fraud, waste and abuse in VA health care programs. An individual can file a complaint with the VA Office of Integrity and Compliance (OIC) using the Department's regular mail (letter), email, hotline telephone line, fax or, in the future, by filing a web-based complaint. The new VA Form 10-390 can be used by individuals to capture information for a fraud, waste or abuse complaint. The form may be submitted anonymously, and there is no requirement to complete all the fields. All complaints are entered into the Compliance Inquiry Reporting &amp; Tracking System (CIRTS), which is used by VA OIC Staff to record and track complaints as they are processed by VA.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, 2024</HD>
                <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
                <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
                <FP>Older Americans are the heart and soul of our families, our communities, and our Nation. But every year, up to five million older Americans face some form of abuse. Around the world, too many are denied the opportunity to age with dignity and security. During World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, we recommit to standing with elder abuse survivors, shedding light on this important issue, and creating a world in which no older person has to live in fear of violence, abuse, or neglect.</FP>
                <FP>Elder abuse comes in many forms. It can include physical or emotional abuse and neglect, sexual violence, or financial exploitation. These and other abuses can leave older Americans with scars, both visible and invisible, that impact them for the rest of their lives. They can happen anywhere—at home, at a care facility, at work, or online.</FP>
                <FP>Elder abuse goes against everything we stand for as a Nation—and my Administration is working relentlessly to stop it. To date, my Administration has dedicated over $430 million to Adult Protective Services, making it easier to investigate reports of elder abuse and give survivors the resources they need to heal—from emergency resources like food, shelter, and law enforcement protection to medical and mental health treatment, legal services, and financial assistance. My new Budget proposes a $30 million investment to sustain and strengthen these resources. Furthermore, I reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act and increased its funding to the highest levels to date—which includes funding for service providers, law enforcement, and prosecutors to respond to domestic and sexual violence experienced by older adults.</FP>
                <FP>Concurrently, we are working to protect the savings that older Americans have worked their entire lives to build up. Last year alone, Americans over 60 years old lost over $3 billion to scams. In response, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and other regulatory agencies are taking aggressive action to identify and crack down on loan scams, mortgage scams, junk fees, and price gouging, which too often prey on older Americans.</FP>
                <FP>Meanwhile, my Administration is working to ensure that older Americans have access to the quality care they deserve—whether they are at home or in another residential setting. By signing an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, I took the most comprehensive set of executive actions in history to support family caregivers and care workers. Additionally, we are helping home care workers get a larger share of Medicaid payments. We are ensuring nursing homes have enough staff to guarantee every resident a safe, quality environment. My new Budget would also significantly expand Medicaid home care services to reduce the long waitlist, ensure nursing homes can be regularly audited for safety and quality, and empower more older Americans to live full lives in settings of their choice.</FP>
                <FP>
                    Globally, my Administration is ensuring that our partnerships with nations abroad reflect the same care for older people that we prioritize here at home. Through the Department of State, local law enforcement agencies 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51786"/>
                    are training their foreign counterparts in best practices to investigate elder abuse and support survivors. We are also working to implement our Strategy on Global Women's Economic Security, which includes a focus on expanding opportunities and protections for caregivers around the world, including older women. With our Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally, we are tackling violence that affects older adults, particularly older women and widows.
                </FP>
                <FP>This World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, let us remember the integral and irreplaceable role that older Americans have in our families, our communities, and our society. Let us recommit to ensuring that they can live with the comfort, dignity, and respect they earned and deserve. Let us celebrate the blessings of their wisdom, their contributions, and their love, which nurture who we are as people and shape all that we are as a Nation.</FP>
                <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 15, 2024, as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. I encourage all Americans to be diligent; work together to strengthen existing partnerships; and develop new opportunities to improve our Nation's prevention of and response to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation.</FP>
                <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.</FP>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Father's Day, 2024</HD>
                <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
                <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
                <FP>Every Father's Day, we pay tribute to the fathers and father figures in our lives who shower us with unconditional love and support. These men shape our character, help us reach our full potential, and believe in us so that we can believe in ourselves. Today, we honor their tremendous sacrifices, their unwavering devotion, and their tireless work to build better futures for our families.</FP>
                <FP>When I was growing up, my father, Joseph Robinette Biden Sr., taught me lifelong values that I have tried to pass down to my own children and grandchildren. Among these many values, he taught me that every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. He taught me that our character is not measured by how many times or how hard we get knocked down; rather, it is measured by how quickly we get back up. He taught me that a job is not just about a paycheck—it is about dignity, pride, and self-worth. All these principles have not only shaped my perspective in life—they are also at the heart of my commitment to building an economy where every father can thrive.</FP>
                <FP>That commitment begins by building an economy from the middle out and bottom up. Toward that aim, my Administration is creating new jobs in manufacturing, construction, clean energy, and more. We are rebuilding American infrastructure with American products built by American workers. We are creating good-paying jobs in people's hometowns so they can support a family without having to move.</FP>
                <FP>At the same time, we also lowered the cost of health insurance premiums for millions of families, giving them some breathing room. We are cutting the cost of prescription drugs, giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices just like the Department of Veterans Affairs does for our veterans. We are trying hard to make child care more affordable and paid leave more accessible. We are working to ensure that our elderly fathers and grandfathers can live their lives with the dignity they deserve by protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid while strengthening access to home care services.</FP>
                <FP>This Father's Day, my heart is also with all the children who have tragically lost a father figure and the fathers who have tragically lost a child. Though the grieving process never truly ends, I know from my own experience that the day will come when the memory of your loved one brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. As we honor all that they meant to us, we recommit to safeguarding their legacies and building a future of possibilities for generations to come. Today and every day, let us remember to cherish the precious moments we have with our dads, stepdads, grandfathers, and father figures and to thank them for all they do to enrich our lives, our families, and our Nation.</FP>
                <FP>
                    NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 16, 2024, as Father's Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on 
                    <PRTPAGE P="51788"/>
                    this day. Let us honor our fathers, living and deceased, and show them the love and gratitude they deserve.
                </FP>
                <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.</FP>
