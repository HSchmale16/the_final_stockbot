Been building various stock trackers trying to take advantage of publically
available information for years. Gave up on that and built something to track
congress. It's shocking how much information is publically available.

May or may not be useful to whoever is looking at it.

The app lives in `/internal/app` with various modules living in `/internal` that plug into the overall app.

It attempts to be modular but really isn't that modular.
